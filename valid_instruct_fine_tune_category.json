        "input_text": "One of the teenagers who was captured on video as she violently beat up a fellow classmate at a Brooklyn McDonald's has been arrested. Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, is one of six that were involved in attacking the other girl, who received no help from any of the other teenagers nearby, and is now being charged as an adult for her role in the incident, in which she also stole the victim's purse and cell phone. Her most recent arrest came last month when she stabbed her brother in the arm, and last year she was arrested after she punched her grandmother in the face. Now authorities are trying to identify the other five girls, despite the fact that no witnesses or even the victim herself will give them any information about the incident. The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, was held for the McDonald's attack . Graphic cell phone footage has emerged of brutal attack on a school girl that took place in Brooklyn after class on Monday afternoon . The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and mock the media response to the fight . According to the New York Daily News, the 15-year-old wrote on Wednesday; 'Everyone Like Im Famous Now.' The graphic cell phone footage emerged earlier this week of the brutal attack  that took place after class on Monday afternoon. The three minute clip showed an unfair fight that began with the victim  being set upon by six other students. As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked. The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence. The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue. Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra. Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off. Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.' The 16-year-old in the fight (left) who was stripped to her bra has been arrested, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench . A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. NYPD have reviewed the video, but there is very little they can do because it doesn’t appear that anyone has filed a complaint, reports the New York Daily News. Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert hopes the victim comes forward and is demanding her assailants be arrested. 'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' he said. Anyone with information about the fight is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.

When basketball players Miles Rodriguez, Scooter Terrien and Chase Vazquez overheard Desiree being abused they called a timeout in their game, walked off the court and confronted the bullies. 'A couple of us went over there and were like, can you guys just stop, that's not right,' Rodriguez told TMJ4. 'Our teammates supported us and they had our backs,' said Terrien. The incident sparked the begining of a beautiful friendship between Desiree and the boys. From then on Desiree – who they call affectionately Dee – got involved in the introduction of the starting lineup for the team. They would also walk her to class and the gym was renamed 'D's House' in her honor. 'We're all created the same. God made us the same way,' said Terrien. Desiree was performing her duties as a member of the Lady Knight's Cheerleading Squad at a game last year when some members of the crowd started picking on her . On Monday the team played their last game in the gymnasium before they all move on to high school. The match was dedicated to Dee and the team chanted, 'Whose house? Dee's house!' Desiree loved every minute of it. 'It was sweet, kind, awesome, amazing,' she said. Her father Cliff Andrews said the team's support for his daughter has 'been a godsend.' 'Those boys, I tried to talk to them in person, but I couldn't keep the tears back,' he told Kenosha News. The story has generated so much positive coverage for the school in the local area that Kenosha City council has announced that it will give the boys a citizenship award next week. They are also being considered for the mayor's youth award. The gymnasium at Lincoln Middle School has been renamed D's House in honor of Desiree Andrews .",

In stark contrast to when the fourth in line to the British throne made his way Down Under the previous two times, his trip next month will revolve around training with Australian troops in army bases in Sydney, Darwin and Perth. When the party boy Prince visited just two years ago, he relished in witnessing first-hand England's win over South Africa in the Rugby World Cup match  in Perth, and also joined in the festivities of the International Fleet Review's centenary celebrations on Sydney Harbour. While on his first Australian visit a decade earlier during his gap year when the prince was just a fresh-faced 18-year-old, he had the opportunity to cuddle up to the country's indigenous wildlife at Sydney's Taronga Zoo. But this time around, in what is believed to be a four-week assignment, the more mature and responsible 30-year-old, who is known in the British Army as Captain Harry Wales, will be participating in a 'challenging' training program specially prepared by the Australian Defence Force. This comes as Prince Harry has announced he will quit the Armed Forces in June after his 10-year-military career. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry will be training in three army bases throughout Australia next month in a stark contrast to his last visit in 2013 when he joined other footy fans in England's win over South Africa in the Rugby World Cup (left) Prince Harry also joined in the International Fleet Review's centenary celebrations on Sydney Harbour in 2013 . On his first visit, ten years earlier the prince had the time to cuddle up to koalas at Taronga Zoo in Sydney . Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the attachment will provide Captain Wales with an opportunity to gain greater insight into the Australian Army's domestic operating environment and capabilities. 'We have prepared a challenging program that will see Captain Wales deploy on urban and field training exercises, domestic deployments, as well as participate in Indigenous engagement activities,' he said. 'While all our units are highly capable, we have selected those units that best utilise Captain Wales' skill sets and give him some experience of the diverse range of capability we have within the ADF. Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said the British and Australian armies have a shared military history with secondments, exchanges, bilateral training and professional development all part of a routine practice between the two armed forces. But this time around, known in the British Army as Captain Harry Wales, he will be participating in a 'challenging' training program specially prepared by the Australian Defence Force . During his gap year when the prince was just a fresh-faced 18-year-old, he had the opportunity to cuddle up to the country's indigenous wildlife (right) at Sydney's Taronga Zoo and don the traditional Akubra hat (left) Prince Harry is greeted by a large crowd during the International Fleet Review in Sydney in 2013 . Prince Harry's assignment with the Australian Army is an extension of his regular British Army duties where he is currently working alongside case officers in the Personal Recovery Unit. 'It will build on his previous experience with coalition forces along with his advocacy work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' Air Chief Marshal Binksin said. 'It is also an opportunity for Australian Army personnel to learn from their British counterpart and I know our Diggers will welcome Captain Wales into the ranks when he arrives in Australia next month.' He will take a short break to attend the Gallipoli Commemorations in Turkey on April 24 and 25 with his father, Prince Charles. In May, he will then move onto New Zealand where he will undertake a short official tour during his first visit to the country at the invitation of the government. After he quits the Armed Forces in June, he will travel onto Africa where he will spend most of the summer undertaking 'field-based conservation work'. Captain Harry Wales, as he is known in the British Army, will visit army bases in Sydney, Darwin and Perth . Known for his sense of humour, Prince Harry pulls a funny face to a child in Sydney during his last visit in 2013 . He will take a short break to attend the Gallipoli Commemorations in Turkey on April 24 and 25 with his father, Prince Charles . In May, he will then move onto New Zealand where he will undertake a short official tour during his first visit to the country at the invitation of the government . The prince will spend the European summer working alongside conservation groups in Africa, after which he will undertake voluntary work with injured servicemen while 'actively considering other longer term employment opportunities'. In a statement Harry, 30, who has served in the military for ten years and seen two tours of duty in Afghanistan, admitted that it had been a 'tough decision' to leave the job he loved. Harry said today that he was 'really excited' about his future, adding: 'So while I am finishing off one part of my life, I am getting straight into a new chapter. I am really looking forward to it. ' But sources close to the prince said he had reached a 'natural crossroads' in his career and, after much soul-searching, had decided he had no desire to 'progress through the ranks'. 'The Prince has had a fulfilling military career and considers it a huge honour to have served his country in the Armed Forces, during which time he has undertaken two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan, qualified as an Apache Aircraft Commander and spearheaded the Invictus Games,' a Kensington Palace spokesman said: . Prince Harry will spend the summer doing voluntary work with injured servicemen, following his success in setting up the inaugural Invictus Games . A spokesman said: 'Prince Harry will spend a period of summer carrying out a programme of voluntary work alongside field-based conservation experts in Africa. He will focus his time learning how local communities in sub-Saharan Africa are working to protect and conserve their natural resources and wildlife.' In September, Harry will return to the UK to work with the Ministry of Defence in a voluntary capacity with its Recovery Capability Programme. This will build on his work on the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style event for injured service personnel, which he helped bring to the UK last year. Kensington Palace said: 'In Autumn, Prince Harry will return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence's Recovery Capability Programme, while actively considering other longer term employment opportunities. 'Prince Harry will continue to support Case Officers at London District's Personal Recovery Unit, working with both those who are administering and receiving physical and mental care within the London District area. This will enable him to continue developing his knowledge of the entire recovery process, placing him in an informed position to further support wounded, injured or sick servicemen and women into the future. ' The fourth in line to the throne will spend the summer working alongside conservation groups in Africa . During his first gap year after leaving school in 2003, the Prince worked with orphans in Lesotho, inspiring him to later set up the charity Sentebale - he is pictured here during a trip to the charity in 2014 . Kensington Palace also stressed that Harry will continue to support the work of the Queen and the Royal Family. In his statement Harry himself said: 'After a decade of service, moving on from the Army has been a really tough decision. I consider myself incredibly lucky to have had the chance to do some very challenging jobs and have met many fantastic people in the process. 'From learning the hard way to stay onside with my Colour Sergeant at Sandhurst, to the incredible people I served with during two tours in Afghanistan - the experiences I have had over the last 10 years will stay with me for the rest of my life. For that I will always be hugely grateful. 'Inevitably most good things come to an end and I am at a crossroads in my military career. Luckily for me, I will continue to wear the uniform and mix with fellow servicemen and women for the rest of my life, helping where I can, and making sure the next few Invictus Games are as amazing as the last. 'I am considering the options for the future and I am really excited about the possibilities. Spending time with the Australian Defence Force will be incredible and I know I will learn a lot. I am also looking forward to coming back to London this summer to continue working at the Personal Recovery Unit. 'So while I am finishing one part of my life, I am getting straight into a new chapter. I am really looking forward to it.'

        "input_text": "The Australian businessman charged with horrific acts of child abuse acted as the ring leader of an international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to investigators. Peter Gerard Scully's latest alleged victim, a 13 year-old girl, has told police she was supposed to meet one of the disgraced businessman's Australian clients and carry out lewd sex acts on camera. However, the girl told investigators plans were changed at late notice and Scully tried to sell her to a German man for the equivalent of $2924 instead, The Age reports. Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. Scully's alleged crimes are so heinous they have led to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty. Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show the 13-year-old girl being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The videos shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines. His alleged victim was also forced to call him 'Uncle Peter' and started working for him, after he had promised to cover her schooling costs. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' the girl said. It is claimed Scully abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers in a lucrative 'pay for view' online child pornography business. Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . Reportedly, Scully slipped out of Melbourne and fled to Manila in 2011 after he allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme. The 52-year-old was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission but avoided being charged with 117 fraud and deception offences, having departed Victoria. He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim. 'Because (he) pay a big amount that's why I had to do that,' his alleged victim told police investigators. The allegations emerged after the father-of-two was arrested last month after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon. He was formally charged on Friday. The Age reports Scully was never charged with child sex crimes in Victoria but a number of associates claimed he had a horrific sexual history. An unnamed former business associate, who lost more than $200,000 in the fraudulent scheme, told The Age he was neither surprised about the recent charges laid against Scully. 'Does it surprise me?' the associate told The Age. 'Yes and no. The signs were always there for him, but it's gone to a dark place.' Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) A search warrant was issued for his arrest in 2012 but Scully remained in the Philippines, where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. It has sparked such an outrage in the Philippines that calls are growing daily to have him executed. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said. The remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully after he was arrested . Scully avoided arrest until February 20 this year before a former partner told police that Scully had killed one of his child victims in 2013. It was after this shocking revelation that the remains of a 10-year-old girl were found at a home formerly rented by Scully. An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.

        "input_text": "The Grand Slam door was slammed in Ireland’s face at the Millennium Stadium as Wales defended their patch like 15 Cardiff bouncers to secure a famous RBS 6 Nations victory. As the Welsh tackle count moved past the 250 mark, it was clear that Ireland had finally met their match. There have been questions about the entertainment value of northern hemisphere rugby but, if ever an advert was needed, this was it. Shaun Edwards punched the air in delight and the championship race lives on. Wales killed off Ireland’s 10-match winning run and – describing himself as ‘a simple Kiwi boy’ in the post-match press conference – Warren Gatland proved that he is a smarter tactician than a tub of Flora. Scott Williams touches down after 62 minutes to score Wales' only try of the game to keep their Six Nations hopes alive . WIlliams makes a break for the line past Tommy Bowe before putting Wales into a commanding second-half lead . Williams goes over while Ireland players look on with dejection as they see their grip at the top the Six Nations weakened by defeat in Wales . Bowe puts his hand to his face in anguish after Williams' try as Wales held on to dash Ireland's hopes of winning the Grand Slam . Wales XV: Halfpenny, North, Davies, Roberts, Williams, Biggar,Webb; Jenkins, Baldwin, Lee, Charteris, Wyn Jones, Lydiate, Warburton (captain), Faletau . Tries: Williams . Penalties: Halfpenny (5) Drop goal: Biggar . Ireland XV: Kearney, Bowe, Payne, Henshaw, Zebo, Sexton, Murray; McGrath, Best, Ross, Toner, O'Connell, O'Mahony, O'Brien, Heaslip. Replacements: Cronin, Healy, Moore, Henderson, Murphy, Reddan, Madigan, Jones . Tries: Penalty . Conversions: Sexton . Penalties: Sexton (3) ‘A lot of our players ran themselves into the ground,’ said Gatland. ‘In terms of atmosphere and intensity, it had everything as a Test match. Sometimes you suffer a loss and the next three or four days are a struggle to get out of bed; we were definitely on it emotionally.’ That emotion was beamed through the exquisite kicking game of full-back Leigh Halfpenny. Ireland’s Jonathan Sexton was dubbed as the player with gold-plated feet, but the celebrated No 10 did not quite live up to his billing. The visitors were shot down in ‘the battle of the skies’ and were forced to dessert their aerial game that was so effective against England. In the early exchanges, Rob Kearney fumbled a short kick-off and Gethin Jenkins won a fine turnover. Sexton kicked a restart straight into touch and Wales were able to build up phases. All the momentum was with the hosts and, after 13 minutes, they were 12-0 up. Welsh forwards coach Robin McBryde has told supporters not to expect a feast of flowing rugby but - despite tickets exchanging hands for £300-a-pair on the blackmarket before kick-off – they were more than happy with what they were seeing. ‘There are a few “what ifs” and “maybes”,’ said Ireland coach Joe Schmidt. ‘You look at the small margins that might potentially have changed the result. Our strategy was the same as the last few weeks but it’s not a case of back to the drawing board. We won’t throw the baby out of the bath water because it’s pretty hard to start all over again.’ Wales were building nicely but their progress was stalled by an injury to Samson Lee in the front-row. Gatland breathed a sigh of relief as Sexton pushed his first penalty wide of the left post, but the No 10 made amends with his second effort following a cheap high tackle by Scott Baldwin. The tables were there to be turned and Ireland identified Lee’s replacement, Aaron Jarvis, as a weakness at the set-piece. They immediately used their choke tackle to set up a scrum, but Sam Warburton stole a dangerous attacking line-out from Devin Toner’s 6ft 11 grasp shortly after. Wales captain Sam Warburton celebrates with the rest of the squad as they do a lap of honour around the Millennium Stadium . It takes two Ireland players to put a stop to Goerge North's burst forward . Jamie Roberts makes a tackle on Rory Best during a spirited defensive performance by the hosts during famous win . Leigh Halfpenny scores the opening points of the match with a Wales penalty at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . It was a carbon-copy of Toner’s pivotal steal against England two weeks ago, however the hard work was undone when the Welsh skipper was sent to the sin-bin after half an hour. Sexton continued to edge his side back with two more penalties – sandwiching a fine drop goal by Dan Biggar – but Wales survived the yellow card with their half-time lead still intact. Gatland was forced into more front-row changes at half-time when he lost Jenkins to a hamstring injury. Ireland needed to change their approach after the break and they enjoyed more possession and territory. Schmidt’s players were consistently penalised for not rolling away in the first half and their discipline improved in the second. They enjoyed more improved territory and possession, but lack the execution in the final third. They camped themselves deep in Welsh territory in the 50th minute but were repelled by a cacophony of noise and fierce tackles. Inspired by the roars, Warburton rallied his players, locked the gates and forced Ireland backwards. In a breath-taking seven minutes, the Welsh defence saw off two full-blooded attacks – combining almost 50 phases – and eventually won the penalty when Sexton went off his feet at the breakdown. Wales outside-half Dan Biggar bags three more first-half points for the hosts as he scores a drop goal . Ireland's Johnny Sexton carries the ball forward for the visitors as Wales skipper Sam Warburton closes in . Ireland's Paul O'Connell organises his side on his 100th cap in the Six Nations clash at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday . Samson Lee  is treated by medics during the first half of the Six Nations clash between Wales and Ireland . Prop forward Lee leaves the field on a stretcher with what looks like a serious leg injury . It was a masterclass at snuffing out attacks - Luke Charteris made a remarkable 37 tackles throughout the game - and proved to be a flashpoint in the Welsh charge. Play moved downfield and Wales built up phases of their own. The forwards carried powerfully - providing the backs with quick, front-foot ball - and two quick passes found replacement centre Scott Williams. The 24-year-old, who had replaced Jamie Roberts because of a dead arm, short-changed Tommy Bowe after 62 minutes and cut through the defence to slide over for the first try of the game. ‘The attitude in defence was second to none,’ said Warburton. ‘Shaun’s gone into a lot of detail all week about certain policies to cover their trick plays in attack. The boys took on all that information and the detail paid off. Certain matches you can tell the boys are extremely focussed, and at breakfast I could see that everyone was so desperate to win.’ Wales were on the brink of their third home victory over Ireland in 33 years, although Ireland were not finished. On the afternoon of his 100th Test, Paul O’Connell turned down a near-certain three points and ordered his fly-half to kick for the corner.

        "input_text": "Roberto Martinez was unmoved. Chomping on a piece of gum, arms folded tightly, Everton’s manager looked like a man who was feeling the tension of the day. The scene that was unfolding around him, however, was completely at odds with his demeanour. In one corner of Goodison Park, Ross Barkley was being mobbed by a group of ecstatic team-mates, while the stands were abuzz with exultant supporters. Barkley had just gracefully and gleefully ensured Everton had equalled their biggest win of a bewildering Barclays Premier League campaign, a 3-0 slaying of a wretched Newcastle United team who finished with 10 men, but, for a second, Martinez appeared reluctant to embrace the moment. James McCarthy (right) opened the the scoring for Everton on Sunday at Goodison Park and was congratulated by Aaron Lennon . Romelu Lukaku, having set up McCarthy for the opener, netted Everton's second from the penalty spot after Lennon was brought down . Ross Barkley celebrates after giving gloss to the victory with a stoppage time strike to make it 3-0 to the home side at Goodison Park . Everton (4-3-3): Howard 7; Coleman 7, Jagielka 7.5, Alcaraz 6.5, Baines 7; McCarthy 8 (Besic 86), Gibson 8, Osman 8.5; Lennon 7.5 (Atsu 83mins), Lukaku 8 (Barkley 74, 7), Kone 7. Unused subs: Garbutt, Naismith, Robles, Stones. Booked: Lennon. Manager: Roberto Martinez 8. Newcastle United (4-2-3-1): Krul 4; Janmaat 5, Coloccini 3, Williamson 5,  Taylor 5; Colback 5 Gouffran 4; Obertan 4 (Perez 46, 5), Sissoko 5; Ameobi 4 (Cabella 58, 5); Riviere 5 (Gutierrez 62, 6). Unused subs: Anita, Armstrong, Elliot, Satka. Booked: Taylor, Sissoko. Sent off: Coloccini. Manager: John Carver 6. Referee: Martin Atkinson 7. Man of the match: Leon Osman. Tim Krul was at fault for the opener, click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone. Soon, though, the magnitude of the result dawned and Martinez was smiling. This was a big victory. The spectre of a relegation battle has been tormenting Everton during what has been a wretched 2015 but here was a scoreline and a performance to ease tensions. James McCarthy set the ball rolling, the excellent Romelu Lukaku secured the win from the penalty spot and Barkley provided the gloss when waltzing on to Christian Atsu’s pass in injury time. True, Newcastle’s resistance was meek but here was a significant step in the right direction. ‘We performed with real desire,’ said Martinez. ‘I thought we were very much in control, and most important of all we played well and wanted to win. In the past we have had a fearful approach in not wanting to lose but we showed what we can do. We dealt with the extra pressure.’ Big efforts on a Thursday night have tended to zap Everton on a Sunday and a return of eight points from a possible 24 immediately after Europa League games has shown what kind of impact progress in that competition has had domestically. Significantly, Martinez was able to shuffle his pack and inject some freshness with five changes to the team that had beaten Dynamo Kiev; it worked perfectly. The return of Darron Gibson, Leon Osman and Aaron Lennon, especially, made Everton a much more vibrant proposition. Sammy Ameobi breaks away from McCarthy down the wing with the two sides goalless at Goodison Park during Sunday's first half . Ameobi fights back gallantly as the winger attempted to stop Everton's on-loan winger Lennon in his tracks . McCarthy fires in his shot from the edge of the area as Fabricio Coloccini chases, but the effort found the net and eased Everton nerves . Finding form in the Barclays Premier League has been difficult for the Toffees who showed their relief in the goal celebrations . Roberto Martinez and John Carver share a laugh on the touchline as their two teams do battle on Merseyside . Jonas Gutierrez, who was again a Newcastle substitute, goes in for a challenge on McCarthy in midfield as Newcastle chase the game . A side with more class than Newcastle might have made things more problematic for Everton and it would have been interesting to see what had happened if either Gabriel Obertan or Mike Williamson had turned in the respective chances that came their way in the second minute. Yet that was as good as it got from Newcastle. Acting manager John Carver argued that his side finished strongly but the reality was they were comfortably beaten and had they returned to Tyneside having lost by six, there could not have been any argument. As soon as McCarthy opened the scoring, the outcome was never in doubt, the Republic of Ireland wrong-footing Tim Krul from 20 yards after Lukaku had laid Phil Jagielka’s long-ball into his path. Krul, really, should have done better but Everton were not complaining. It was, incredibly, McCarthy’s first shot on target in the Premier League for 10 months but it could not have come at a better time, as the relief around Goodison was almost tangible. This stadium can be unforgiving when things are going badly but here they were ready to enjoy themselves. Being unable to get a second goal before the interval caused a few murmurs but, with Newcastle’s play becoming more abject by the minute, there was never any sense Everton would get pegged back and they ended the contest in the 56th minute. Referee Martin Atkinson had no hesitation pointing to the spot after Yoan Gouffran got into a tangle and upended Lennon and Lukaku did the rest, rolling his kick into the Gwladys Street, just as he had done against Kiev. The Belgian had taken 20 penalties in training on Wednesday and scored 17. Newcastle’s task was made impossible when Coloccini was dismissed for clattering into Lennon – Carver said he would appeal if he felt Newcastle had a case but when he studies the video, he will realise an appeal would be futile – and that prompted the visiting fans to again barrack Mike Ashley. It was another one of those days for Newcastle but Carver, to his credit, would not throw in the towel. Lukaku steps up to slot home his second penalty of the week after also netting in the Europa League on Thursday night at Goodison Park . Tim Krul dived the wrong way and Lukaku simply had to find the net with his spot-kick, which he duly did to double the lead . The big Belgian forward celebrates after effectively sealing Everton's first win at Goodison Park of the calendar year on Sunday afternoon . Coloccini lunges in on Lennon within three minutes of Everton's second goal and is shown the red card by referee Martin Atkinson . Mike Williamson slides in to deny Arouna Kone as Everton surged forward in search of a third goal against their 10-man opponents . Barkley rounds Krul during stoppage time to add Everton's third after an impressive performance from the substitutes' bench . ‘There was a lot of disappointment after the game, usually, we leave them for a couple of days, but I asked the guys if they had anything to say, and two or three did,’ said Carver. ‘It was sensible, I won't name names, but they had something to say. There weren't tea cups thrown, they were sensible, and examined it well. I can't be down. I have never thrown the towel anywhere, and I won't do it here. I want them to be positive.’ On this evidence, that will prove easier said than done. The England youngster angles in his shot as Newcastle's defenders and the rest of Goodison Park can only watch on as it happens . Barkley celebrates his strike with the Merseyside crowd who were delighted to see their side win at home for the first time this year . The Newcastle players applaud the travelling fans who have hung around after the final whistle despite their heavy defeat at Goodison .",

        "input_text": "A 15-year-old boy was arrested Wednesday in the short-lived kidnapping of a 22-month-old toddler that was caught on surveillance video in this small farming town in eastern Washington. The teenage boy, who lives in Sprague, was identified through the use of surveillance video, interviews and evidence collection, Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers said. The boy's identity was being withheld because he is a juvenile, Magers said. 'Over the past 72 hours, deputies and detectives have worked relentlessly on this case,' Magers said in a news release. Scroll down for video... Caught: Authorities have identified the attempted kidnapper in this surveillance footage as a Washington 15-year-old boy. Sprague, Washington authorities have arrested him but have declined to ID him because he is a minor . Detectives started focusing on the teen in the 24 hours before the arrest, Magers said. 'Additional evidence, interviews, DNA collection and surveillance was conducted,' Magers said. 'A search warrant was executed at the suspect's residence.' One of the kidnap victim's young siblings also positively identified the suspect, Magers said. The 15-year-old was booked into a juvenile detention facility on suspicion of second-degree kidnapping, Magers said. The Lincoln County prosecutor's office will make the formal charging decisions. Meanwhile, the brother and sister who bravely gave chase to the teen have spoken about the moments leading up to young Owen Wright being snatched. Brenden, 10, Delicia, 8, and Owen were approached by the stranger as they played in a park in the tiny town of Sprague, Washington, after their babysitter had left them unattended on Sunday. Heroes: Delicia Wright, 8, said that the kidnapper told them he was nice to kids and had been babysitting for a long time, she didn't believe him and her screams helped raise the alarm . Brave: Breden said he wasn't scared by the kidnapper and jumped into action because they he wanted his brother back so they could go to their cousin's birthday party . 'He said he was nice to kids and he had been babysitting for a long time,' Delicia told Good Morning America. Surveillance video shows the man running down the sidewalk with the toddler in his arms. In hot pursuit are Owen's brother and sister. 'I thought he was trying to kidnap him so I ran and screamed,' said Delicia. Big brother Breden said he wasn't scared by the teen and jumped into action because they had an important family function to attend. 'I was chasing him so I could get my brother back for my cousin's birthday party,' he explained. The dramatic scene ended after a pair of local teenagers also chased after the kidnapper and he set the boy down and ran off on Sunday, authorities said. Michael Wright, the father of the three children, said he was relieved that young Owen was unhurt and very proud of his other kids' bravery. 'For my kids to run after him that is an act of courage,' he said. Nicole and Michael Wright hold their 22-month-old son Owen who was abducted from Sprague City Park on Sunday. Owen's sister Delicia, 8, and brother Brenden, 10, were with the toddler and alerted a pair of teenage boys . Wright had left his three children with a babysitter on Sunday while he went to work. They were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house. 'I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,' Wright told KXLY-TV. Sheriff's deputies said the 15-year-old talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. Surveillance video from a grocery store showed the kidnapper running, child in arms, with Delicia chasing and Brenden not far behind. 'I said there is something wrong,' she recalled on Tuesday. 'Then this man busts out and runs across the street and he's got a baby and a little girl right behind him screaming,' Giddings said. Isaac Yow, 16, who, along with friend Andrew Crane, 15, chased a 15-year-old who tried to abduct a toddler from a park on Sunday afternoon . 'The girl said, 'That man got my baby brother! That man got my baby brother!'' Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her teenage grandson and his friend to chase the man. As the older boys approached, the kidnapper put the child down in a vacant lot and fled. No vehicle was seen with the suspect. Authorities said they don't believe the kidnapper is a resident of Sprague, a wheat farming town of about 500 people located 40 miles west of Spokane. 'We'd recognize him if he was local.' said Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers. 'We are leaning on somebody coming through town.' Authorities have no leads in the case. Delicia's screams alerted Dorothy Giddings, who was working at her antique store downtown, reports. Miss identified: Witnesses originally said the kidnapper was around 30-years-old, 6-foot-2 and had a mustache . Owen's older sister Delicia, left, and brother Brenden, right, were also captured on security video footage as they gave chase after the man who had taken their younger brother Owen .",

        "input_text": "Philadelphia police this morning identified the two brothers who have been charged with the murder of a police officer who was gunned down while trying to stop a video game store robbery. During a press conference held at 11.15am Friday, Philadelphia Police Capt. Darrell Clark named the suspects in the fatal shooting of Officer Robert Wilson III as Ramone Williams, 26, and Carlton Hipps, 30, . Williams had two prior arrests, while Hipps had six arrests and had been out on parole since 2009 following a robbery conviction. The pair of suspects have been charged with murder and attempted murder. Partners in crime: Carlton Hipps (left), 30, and Ramone Williams (right), 26, have been charged with the murder of a police officer inside a Philadelphia video game store . Officer: Philadelphia Police Officer Robert Wilson III, 30 (photographed), died Thursday after being shot in the head during an attempted robbery at a video-game store on the city's north side . Wilson, 30, was in a north Philadelphia GameStop in full uniform buying a video game for his 8-year-old son for getting good grades when the two suspects entered and announced a robbery. Wilson immediately confronted the suspects, and the three exchanged gunfire, with the assailants firing rounds at close range on either side of the officer, Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters. Wilson was struck multiple times in his body but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head, Ramsey said. 'The officer was an out-and-out hero and a warrior,' Captain Clark told reporters Friday. 'He fought to the end.' Wilson's partner, Officer Stevenson, was outside of the store and exchanged fire with one of the assailants. The second assailant fled and attempted to blend in with the crowd but was caught at the scene. One was shot in the leg, Ramsey said, but it is unclear if the assailant was shot by Wilson or his partner. According to police, Williams confessed to the fatal robbery, telling investigators during questioning that he and his brother had thought the GameStop was going to be an easy target. Wilson was rushed to Temple University Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6.25pm, NBC reports. Wilson was an eight-year veteran of the department, a husband, and a father of two boys, ages 1 and eight. His older son will celebrate his 9th birthday Monday. GameStop: Wilson was in full uniform inside a North Philadelphia GameStop (photographed) as part of his patrol duties when two armed men entered the store and announced a robbery . Struck: Wilson was struck multiple times but continued to fire until he was fatally shot in the head (here, Wilson's body is transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office) Procession: A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office . Never Forgotten: Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten' 'Take a moment and say a prayer for this family,' Ramsey said. 'And this 9-year-old boy who will now grow up without a father. A 1-year-old is going to grow up without a dad because of what happened today.' Authorities later found the suspect's weapons in the store: a .40-caliber and a 9mm. Another weapon, an AK-47, was recovered during a search warrant at one of the suspects' home, Ramsey said. In all, over 50 shots were fired during the gun battle inside the video game store. Police say both the suspects were repeat offenders and one was on parole at the time of the shooting. The suspect who was shot was taken to a local hospital but his condition has not been released, NBC reports. Wilson was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting, Ramsey said. However, a surveillance camera in the store captured the incident. The video has been reviewed by homicide investigators. A procession was held for the officer Thursday as his body was transported by ambulance to the Medical Examiner's Office. At the news conference, Ramsey said he met Wilson and his partner when they took part in a recent pilot program in which officers wore body cameras. He described the father of two as a 'very, very brave, heroic individual.' 'People tend to lose sight of the dangers inherent in being a police officer,' Ramsey said. 'Sometimes they're seriously injured or even murdered as a result of trying to protect every single person in this city...He put his life on the line to make Philadelphia a better city and a safer city.' Volunteer: Wilson (left) was a volunteer in the department's body-camera program but is was not immediately known if he was wearing one at the time of the shooting . Condolences: Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering his condolences to Wilson's family and his colleagues . Department officials posted on the Philadelphia Police Department's Facebook page writing that Wilson's sacrifice will 'never, ever, be forgotten.' Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering his condolences to Wilson's family and his colleagues. 'This senseless act is devastating and a stark reminder of the danger faced everyday by our brave men and women in uniform,' Wolf said. 'Across Pennsylvania, members of law enforcement and our first responders put their lives on the line to protect our families and our communities. We can never forget their selfless service and sacrifice.' Wilson is the fifth Philadelphia Police officer to die due to a gun shot wound since 2007, according to the Fraternal Order of Police.",

David Boren expressed outrage today at the racist song by members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon and revealed that school officials have already identified at least two of the students seen singing 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' on a party bus over the weekend. 'We will look at all possible punishment and what is available to us under the law. Under the civil rights law it may be possible for us to take action against certain individuals,' he said. 'Would I be happy if they left voluntarily? Yes. We don't have room for racists and bigots here.' He added: 'I don't want them here. I'll pay the bus fare to get them out. They're not coming back.' Scroll down for video . Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident . University of Oklahoma President David Boren used a bullhorn to address students Monday morning at a rally against the SAE fraternity . Fraternity members moved furniture out of the house in the rain on Monday afternoon. They've been told the vacate the premises by midnight . This student's parents helped him move his belongings out of the SAE house into the back of their Cadillac Escalade SUV . A mother puts a comforting arm around her son in the wake of his fraternity being kicked off campus and shamed the world over for a racist chant . Hundreds of furious students have rallied on campus in Norman this morning to protest the outrageous song by the fraternity brothers. Boren's comments come as a new video emerges that shows a frat brother trying to stop the recording of the sickening song aboard the Sigma Alpha Epsilon party bus. As one tuxedo-clad brother gleefully sings, 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** in SAE' - another stands up and waves his hands in front of a cell phone camera, attempting to stop the filming of the shameful song. Earlier on Monday, Boren gave the fraternity members less than 24 hours to vacate their house on campus. He may have offered to buy the frat members a bus ticket out of town - but it seems some of the members will drive a Cadillac instead. An Escalade SUV was among several vehicles - including two U-Haul trucks that were parked outside the fraternity on Monday morning, according to KOCO-TV. Fraternity members refused to talk to members of the press as they packed up their belongings and loaded them into the trucks. According to the campus student newspaper, the Oklahoma Daily,  several fraternity members were also seen fleeing the house on Sunday night with packed suitcases. At a rally on Monday morning, shamed the fraternity brothers, according the Oklahoman newspaper: 'You are disgraceful! Real Sooners are not bigots, real Sooners are not racist.' Fury: Hundreds of students rallied on the campus in Norman, Oklahoma, on Monday morning to protest the horrific chant by the fraternity members . Using the slogan 'Unheard' black students - and their allies - used the occasion to protest what they say is a history of racism at the university . Students refused to speak with reporters as they packed up and left the fraternity. They loaded their belongings into U-Haul trucks and SUVs . Packing up: U-Haul trucks and several SUVs appeared at the SAE fraternity to move members and their belongings out of the house ahead of the midnight deadline to vacate the premises . The OU mascot is the Sooner - in honor of the homesteaders who took up plots of land across the state in the late 19th century. In a statement, he said that the members of SAE have until midnight Tuesday morning to clear everything out of the fraternity house. 'Effective immediately, all ties and affiliations between this University and the local SAE are hereby severed. I direct that the house be closed and that members will remove their personal belongings from the house by midnight tomorrow,' he said. A vandal approached the house an spray painted 'Tear It D' across the wall of the frat house - presumably meaning to paint 'tear it down.' At the SAE chapter at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, a Confederate flag could be seen hanging in the bedroom of one of the fraternity brothers. It was visible from the street through the fraternity's window, according to the O'Colly student newspaper. It has since been taken down. Coming down: University workers on Monday tore down the Greek letters for SAE on the fraternity house - after officials cut all ties to the fraternity . Frat house: The SAE base at the University of Oklahoma is pictured above. The university has cut off all ties to the fraternity and will ban it from campus . Fraternity members refused to speak to members of the media on Monday . Parents came out in to help their college children move out of the fraternity house on Monday . Alumni of the fraternity have also begun raising money Howard, the African-American cook who ran the kitchen at the fraternity for more than 10 years. Blake Burkhart wrote on the IndieGoGo campaign: 'That man is going to walk up to the SAE house tomorrow morning and hear that he no longer has a job. He is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade. He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids.' The campaign has raised more than $11,000 toward its goal of $50,000 to help provide support for Howard after losing his job. Also on Monday, rapper Waka Flocka Flame canceled his show at scheduled for this spring at the fraternity house. In a statement, the Atlanta-based musician said: 'I must say I'm disgusted and disappointed in the actions of the SAE fraternity at University of Oklahoma and I will be canceling my scheduled performance for them next month. Racism is something I will not tolerate.' The racist footage that kicked it all off was uploaded to YouTube Sunday and shows members of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter singing that there 'will never be a n*****' in their fraternity. In the brief clip, one two students stand up to a group of their peers, wearing bow ties and dress shirts, in the vile chant, sung to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It. The footage is believed to have been filmed on Saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on Selma, Alabama, where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march. 'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma . National heads of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the fraternity Sunday night after the video was shared widely online, and suspended all of its members. During the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing: 'There will never be a n***** SAE, there will never be a n***** SAE. 'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE.' A female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend: 'You've never heard it before?' The footage shows the group on a bus, apparently headed to a party. It was made public by a black students' pressure group at the university called Unheard. In the wake of the video, the national leadership of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has branches across the country, said the University of Oklahoma chapter would be punished. Reaction: The national heads of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said those responsible will be punished . Brad Cohen, the Eminent Supreme Archon of the organization, confirmed that the video was authentic. He added that he was 'shocked and disgusted' by it, and said those responsible 'will be dealt with'. Cohen also said the song, which the video participants seemed to know well, was not part of any SAE traditions. A statement from SAE said: 'Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video. 'In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently. At Oklahoma State University, the SAE chapter has a Confederate flag clearly visible from the street, hanging in the bedroom of one of the fraternity brothers . A vandal painted 'TREAR IT D' - presumably 'tear it down' - on the wall of the fraternity on Sunday night . 'We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. 'Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.' SAE has more than 200 chapters across the country, 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni. The mission of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is 'to promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship, and service for our members based upon the ideals set forth by our Founders and as specifically enunciated in our creed, The True Gentleman.' For more than half a century, new members are required to memorize and recite the following: . 'A True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.'",

        "input_text": "The chilling February murder allegedly committed by a Coast Guardsman from Virginia who drove 600 miles to kill a lesbian servicewoman with whom he was infatuated may have been videotaped. New court documents reveal Adrian Loya, 31, strapped a video camera to his chest before invading the Massachusetts home of Lisa Trubnikova and her wife Anna in early February, shooting them both and killing 31-year-old Lisa. Police say Loya wanted to enshrine the terrified final moments of the woman who, while serving alongside him in Alaska refused to reciprocate his advances, and said as much in a 250-page essay he allegedly left for authorities detailing why Lisa had to die. Scroll down for video . Horrific: The chilling case of accused Coast Guard killer Adrian Loya (center) became all the more shocking after new court documents revealed the 31-year-old allegedly recorded the murder of servicewoman Lisa Trubnikova in order to capture her terrified final moments . According to court documents, Loya had already been recording the couple using a video camera he'd affixed to a tree outside their Cape Cod home. On his own 31st birthday, Loya drove from Chesapeake, Virginia to the Trubnikovas' home in Bourne, police say. Before reaching the home, police say Loya blocked a street with his car and then set it ablaze and scattered fake bombs around it to slow down police. Armed with three rifles and a handgun, Loya then allegedly donned a black mask and the chest camera, shot his way into the house and then confronted the couple in their bedroom. Loya allegedly then ordered the couple to stand and opened fire. Lisa Trubnikova was shot in the legs and torso and killed, reports the Boston Globe. Lisa's wife of just two years was also critically injured, but managed to call 911 and summon police. As he fled the home and zigzagged around their neighborhood, police say Loya opened fire on them.One police officer, Jared MacDonald, was shot in the back. Tragic: Loya is accused of shooting his way into the home of Lisa and Anna Trubnikova and killing Lisa (right), with whom he'd allegedly been infatuated . Documented everything: Loya allegedly left behind a 250-page essay on his reasons for wanting Lisa dead for police to find . Loya would surrender about a half hour later. In his motel room nearby, police would discover face masks, handcuff keys, duct tape, fire-starting material, a survival handbook, a mess kit, a first aid kit, zip ties, a knife sharpener, and other items, reports the Boston Globe. Loya has since been charged with first degree murder and ordered held without bail, though he remains at a facility where he was subsequently sent for a psychiatric evaluation. His attorney J. Drew Segadelli told the Globe there's more to the case than meets the eye. 'This isn't the entire bulk of the evidence,' he said. 'I still think there's some skepticism as I review the police investigation,' However, prosecutors remained confident they had more than enough evidence for the first degree premeditated murder charge to stick. And when police told Lisa's relatives of the incident, their immediate reaction was that Loya had been 'fixated' on Lisa since working with the couple in Alaska. 'He became obsessed,' a family member told the Boston Globe. 'He was fixated on her.' Unthinkable: After driving some 600 miles to the Trubnikovas' home, police say Loya blocked the road to their condo with his car, set is ablaze and then scattered fake bombs to slow down police . Obsessed? Lisa's family says Loya had been obsessed with Lisa since he served with her and her wife in Alaska some years ago . Lisa and Anna, who married two years ago in New York, were stationed at different bases in Massachusetts, and worked together with Loya in Alaska several years ago. Lisa was a Coast Guard Petty Officer 2nd Class of Coast Guard Base Cape Cod, and Anna is a Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class of Coast Guard Sector Southeastern New England. According to Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe, the attack appeared to be calculated. Loya checked into a hotel near the couple's residence two days before the shooting. 'I think there was a significant amount of planning involved,' O'Keefe said. 'He wasn't crazy,' said Lisa's older brother Luis Berlanga. 'He knew what he was doing.' After his arrest, police say Loya told them he killed Lisa 'based upon a prior interaction' that 'made up his mind that he was going to arrive at her residence in Bourne and murder her.' Court documents did not specify what or where that interaction was. Anna Trubnikova survived the attack but is now without her wife after just two years of marriage .",

Jose Mario, 15, a goalkeeper at Fulham, defended the Spanish midfielder and insisted he did not deserve to be singled out for criticism. Fabregas has struggled to hit the heights he set during the first half of the season when he made 13 assists and Jose Mario claimed supporters were on his back on Sunday. Jose Mario Mourinho (left, watching a game last season and with his dad) has criticised Chelsea fans . Jose Mario celebrates winning Chelsea's Capital One Cup victory with some of the players . Jose Mario took to Instagram to criticise Chelsea's fans before deleting his account . Jose Mario stands up behind the Chelsea dugout as he watches the team play Manchester City in 2013 . Cesc Fabregas was booed by some Chelsea fans during Sunday's draw with Southampton at Stamford Bridge . The 27-year-old has not scored or assisted a goal in his last 10 games in all competitions and the last goal he made was against Swansea on January 17. But Jose Mario, who is regularly seen at Stamford Bridge supporting the team and celebrated on the Wembley pitch with players after Chelsea won the Capital One Cup earlier this month, wrote on Instagram: 'Why is everyone hating and blaming Fabregas for Sunday's performance… It was a team effort. 'Fabregas might have not played as well as most expected but at least he kept fighting… Showed a lot of character, I've seen bad Chelsea fans but Sunday was the worse I've ever seen, Fans booing Cesc not singing at all, I completely agree with the chant 'Mourinho's right, you're fans are s****' 'Our fans are a disgrace!!!!'

Jose Mario tells one Instagram user that the clubs young players are not ready to play in the Premier League . Mourinho with his wife Matilde Faria . Responding to comments left by other Instagram users, Jose Maria also wrote that: . Responding to two users criticism, Jose Maria wrote: 'I'll show the fans some respect, when the fans respect the team.' To another user, he wrote: 'Who has been scoring goals??? Iva... Willian he is just having a bad time, every player has that doesn't mean you can boo them and put their momentum down... Oscar, he hasn't done anything wrong, please elaborate, cuz I don't see anything wrong with him.' To the same user, he also wrote: 'That's why every single staff of Chelsea hate Chelsea fans!! Oscar has created a lot of our chances... Willian and Ivanovic are probably the players who track back the most they don't stop running Ivanovic has saved us this season, scored so many goals and helped beat Liverpool with their s****y youngsters... Willian put the cross in... You need to remember who you are talk to and realise I know a lot more than you.' And in a third exchange with the same user, he added: 'Does it look like any of our youth are good enough to play in the best league in the world... No they are too young too weak... if fans kept supporting Fabregas he could change his mind set, booing him won't make him better at all.' Jose Maria has since deleted his Instagram account. Chelsea refused to comment when approached by Sportsmail on two occasions. Jose Maria is following in his dad's footsteps in criticising Chelsea's fans. At the end of last year, Mourinho was unhappy at the support his side were receiving at Stamford Bridge. Speaking in November, Mourinho said: 'I can clearly say we are the team to get less support in home matches. I think it’s getting worse. When comparing to my pre­vious time, I think it’s getting worse. I don’t question the passion and the love – I’m nobody to question that and I know clearly that’s not true.

        "input_text": "For Steve Clarke, there were no apologies, no guilt and no sense of remorse. He deemed the nine changes before their defeat at Watford necessary if Reading are to be ready for Bradford in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Monday night. Of those nine, four were making full debuts. Discounting Simon Cox, the rest of the Royals side had made just 34 Championship starts between them this season. Whatever Clarke says, this was an unwrapped gift to a team chasing promotion to the Premier League. But the manager must be well down the list when blame is apportioned. Jem Karacan's Reading team-mates gather to congratulate the midfielder after his goal against Watford . Steve Clarke played a decidedly under strength side at Vicarage Road that will completely change on Monday . Reading's Pavel Pogrebnyak and Bradford's Stephen Darby clash in the 0-0 draw that forced Monday's FA Cup replay at the Madejski Stadium, with both sides nursing their squads in the lead-up to the fixture . It is the fault of broadcasters that he had just 48 hours between leaving Vicarage Road on Saturday and kicking off against Phil Parkinson’s Bradford on Monday evening. Domestic cup fixtures cannot be played on the same night as Champions League games and, as such, there is no way around this ludicrous situation. Clarke is expected to name a completely fresh XI at the Madejski Stadium, while Parkinson, who made six changes of his own side for the 1-1 draw at Notts County, will mix and match, too. Bradford had five players who retained their place from the Cup game. Reading had none. Fifteen changes was the sum total and for one reason only. Clarke is dealing with a ludicrous 48-hour turnaround between playing Watford and Bradford . These will be two teams going hell for leather in a competition they have prioritised. Their tedious goalless draw at Valley Parade last week may have been wretched to watch, but this tie is harking back to the FA Cup’s old days, neither side giving an inch. They could not bear losing at this stage. Reading supporters won’t remember the 4-1 defeat at Watford in a decade’s time, but a day out at Wembley, taking on holders Arsenal, would stick in the memory should they progress. The Royals have nothing to play for in the league. They are safe and will not trouble the second tier’s play-offs. Almen Abdi (centre) scored the opener against a Reading side with nothing to play for in the league . And club captain Jem Karacan, who made only his second appearance for the club since September 2013 because of injury, backed his manager’s decision to ring the changes. ‘The gaffer has to bear the replay in mind,’ said Karacan, who scored his side’s consolation as Watford ran riot with strikes from Almen Abdi, Matej Vydra, Troy Deeney and Fernando Forestieri. ‘If you put a team out that doesn’t win at Watford you get criticised, but if you don’t win on Monday you get criticised as well so it’s a catch-22 for the gaffer. ‘Playing at Wembley is one of those things that you just can’t describe. The feeling we had when we went there before (the 2011 Championship play-off final loss to Swansea) will always stay with me.’ Reading's Yakubu Aiyegbeni passes under pressure as his side struggled against the promotion hopefuls . Parkinson has had a trickier balancing act. Bradford are three points beneath the League One play-offs and will have two games in hand once Tuesday’s programme of fixtures is complete. He couldn’t afford to make changes quite so wholesale for their trip to Nottingham, knowing promotion is by no means out of the question. Those in West Yorkshire will think of two years ago when they were capable of juggling that fairytale journey to the Capital One Cup final and the league campaign, which ended in promotion from League Two. Reading will doubtless have the fresher side tonight and Parkinson knows his team blew their best chance of reaching the semi-finals. But they feed off adrenaline. Just ask Chelsea and Sunderland. Two games in three days will not faze this collection of loanees and cast-offs. After all, Arsenal await. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Maybe, just maybe, Ronnie Moore can inspire Hartlepool to Football League survival. Marooned at the foot of League Two for months, all looked lost. The 1-0 win at Morecambe - thanks to an Andy Parrish own goal - was their first three points on the road since October, their first clean sheet away from Victoria Park for 12 months and puts them within two results of safety. No wonder defender Scott Harrison was close to tears in the dressing room afterwards. WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE .",

Remarkably the Latics then went on a four-match winning run away from home, including Saturday’s 2-1 win at relegation rivals Rotherham, to give themselves hope in the Championship.\nIt might finally be time for Preston to return to the Championship.

Hodgson and McGinley were interviewed on stage by Sky Sports’ David Jones on the subject of leadership. But Hodgson paled next to McGinley, who gave a masterclass at the Lord’s function in explaining the attention to detail, perception and man-management which went into beating the USA at Gleneagles. It would not have been McGinley’s intention but his thoroughly modern approach to leading a team only exposed Hodgson’s old-school philosophy.

Co-owner Fergie and Nicholls were so keen for the Ditcheat trainer’s head lad Clifford Baker to ride the winner that his fancied mount Rainy City, who cost £100,000, had exploited the grey areas of eligibility for the last race on the Festival card yesterday. The regulations, confirmed by a Cheltenham spokeswoman, state that horses in the line-up should all have been given an average BHA rating to ensure a competitive race. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and Paul Nicholls (left) were at Cheltenham to watch Rainy City finish fifth . Yet Rainy City, who is highly thought of in the Nicholls yard, had no BHA rating, and rival jockeys were concerned that Fergie’s horse was far superior to the rest of the field. The get-out clause buried in the fine print was that any horse without a rating could be handicapped by Cheltenham at their discretion. In the event, Rainy City finished an outpaced fifth, having led for most of the 1m 5f. Nicholls said: ‘Of course we wanted to win. But it’s a charity race and we entered to give Clifford a ride.’ Arena Racing Company, who own racecourses that stage 40 per cent of UK fixtures, still chose to hold their annual drinks party during Cheltenham, even though it is not one of their tracks. ARC are owned by the Reuben brothers, the billionaire property developers who have caused serious upset by closing down popular racecourse Hereford and moving its meetings to the over-raced Chepstow and Uttoxeter tracks. Hereford is now empty most of the time as part of a long-term property play between the local council and the Reuben brothers, who are never seen at the races.

LTA chairman David Gregson had said Downey would receive a £300,000 salary on his appointment but it seems the excesses of the Roger Draper regime are already in danger of being repeated. LTA chief executive Michael Downey was not his usual suited self in Glasgow - he wore a GB tracksuit top . There will be only five more racing days after Saturday before Clare Balding turns her back on presenting the sport following Royal Ascot. But the Balding effect has not boosted Channel 4’s viewing figures — quite the reverse. The Cheltenham peak of 996,000 was down again on Wednesday, year on year, by 20,000. And the last time Cheltenham enjoyed four consecutive days of 1m-plus ratings was pre-Balding in 2012, when Highflyer produced the coverage and John McCririck, John Francome and Derek Thompson were all still on board. Clare Balding arrives at Cheltenham Festival, but her presence has not helped viewing figures . Only Cheltenham could consider £30,000 for two season tickets in the Cheltenham Club good value. However, 100 of the 300 memberships available for the grand top-floor facility in the new £45million grandstand, which are being sold on a minimum three-year basis, have already been bought.

        "input_text": "The world’s leading authority on the detection of banned performance-enhancing drug EPO in blood says a particularly low level of the substance is explicable only by renal damage or doping — a conclusion that raises fresh doubts over historic alleged doping by a current staff member at Team Sky. As The Mail on Sunday reported last week, court documents in France show that an expert at a 2001 criminal trial concluded from a blood sample taken from a Dutch rider, Servais Knaven, that he had taken artificial EPO. The toxicology reports that led to testimony that Knaven had taken EPO were compiled by two doctors whose evidence was challenged in court, but the court ruled it was good evidence. Knaven has been a ‘directeur sportif’ with vital strategic responsibilities at Team Sky since 2011 and was a 27-year-old rider with Dutch team TVM when the sample was taken during the 1998 Tour de France. Dave Brailsford, former director Sean Yates and Servais Knaven (second right) with Bradley Wiggins in 2012 - a 1998 sample from Knaven showing an EPO level of 0.7 was used to convict traffickers in a French court . The technical paperwork relating to his blood tests carried out by an expert, Francoise Bressolle, showed an EPO level of 0.7. Team Sky say their own unnamed experts, paid by them to examine documents unearthed by the MoS, have exonerated Knaven of any wrongdoing, for reasons unspecified. Knaven was never on trial and therefore did not have an opportunity to challenge the medical evidence; rather his tests and testimony were used to convict EPO traffickers. Knaven never disputed the reading of 0.7 but denied ever taking EPO. Now Robin Parisotto, who invented the first ever blood tests to detect EPO, has told the MoS: ‘The only known causes of such a low EPO level in blood [0.7] is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys cannot sustain normal production of natural/endogenous EPO and/or the current and previous administration of recombinant [banned] EPO.’ Directeur sportif for Team Sky Knaven signed a police statement in 1998 saying he did not contest the EPO finding. He said he believed it may have been due to ‘great exertion’, which expert Robin Parisotto . Sky did not answer our specific questions but gave this statement: . ‘This relates to events over 15 years ago that were contested and well documented at the time. We looked carefully at the information provided to us by The Mail on Sunday last week, including a review by a panel of three independent world-class experts. Nothing here, including the new medical opinion, causes us, or the experts, to change our view. There is no proof of Doping. Servais Knaven continues to maintain his innocence and to be a valued member of Team Sky.' The MoS has asked Knaven and Team Sky if Knaven had renal damage at the 1998 Tour de France. They have not answered. Parisotto was lead researcher on the pioneering EPO tests, first implemented at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. These tests have morphed into the athlete biological passport and since been adopted by a number of international sporting bodies. Parisotto also currently sits on the biological passport panel of cycling’s world governing body, the UCI. In 1998, Knaven signed a police statement saying he did not contest the EPO finding, but said he did not know why it was so low. He told police he believed it may have been due to ‘great exertion’. Parisotto says: ‘I don’t think that “great exertion” is a plausible explanation for such a low EPO level.’ FRENCH COURT DOCUMENTSNo 1:  This is an extract from the court expert’s summary, specifically in relation to Knaven’s blood and his EPO level, saying in her opinion this was a result of the ‘feedback’ phenomenon where the body is now producing such low levels of EPO as it had recently stopped taking artificial EPO. It finishes by saying: ‘Conclusion: Took exogenous EPO.’ No 2: An extract from the official court summary of the case showing expert witness BRESSOLLE had concluded EPO use by four of the TVM riders, from blood samples. Knaven was one of those four. Ouchakov, Blijelevens and Voskamps were the others. No 3: A summary of an interview, quoting Knaven’s own words, following a police interview on 3 Dec 1998, signed by Servais Knaven to show it is an authentic and accurate representation of what he had said in that interview. He says: ‘I do not dispute this rate [of 0.7]. On the other hand, if this rate is so low, it can result from lots of things other than stopping taking EPO. At least that is what I’ve heard from lawyers and doctors. I believe these people all the more because I’ve never taken EPO. ‘For my part, although I am not a doctor, I think that this perhaps comes from the fact this is due to an earlier great effort.’ No 4: The vital readings that Mrs Bressolle found in Knaven’s blood. The key figure here is the EPO reading in the body: 0.7. This was an abnormally low reading. Last week we revealed that The Mail on Sunday had unearthed a collection of documents, never published or reported before, containing detail about the involvement of Servais Knaven, Team Sky’s Sporting Director, in one of cycling’s major doping scandals. Last week’s revelations came after months of in-depth investigations. When we passed our findings to Team SKY, they refused to act. Most major cycling teams, including Team Sky, have employed former dopers in the past three years - either as riders, coaches, doctors or all three, and there is no rule against this, but Team Sky have a ‘zero tolerance’ (ZT) policy, meaning that if past doping comes to light, that person must leave. Several Team Sky staff have left after confessions since 2012, but not Knaven. Question 1 . The world’s leading blood expert on EPO, Robin Parisotto, has examined the paperwork from Reims. Parisotto invented the first blood tests to detect EPO and sits on the biological passport panel of the UCI. He says the testing Francoise Bressolle did on Knaven’s blood remains credible, concluding: ‘The only known causes of such a low EPO level in blood is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys cannot sustain normal production of natural/endogenous EPO and/or the current and previous administration of recombinant EPO.’ Did Servais Knaven have renal damage at the Tour de France in 1998? If not, what is his own explanation for that EPO reading, which he did not contest as accurate in a signed police statement in 1998? Question 2 . Servais Knaven’s urine from July 28 1998 showed irregular levels of a banned drug, cortisone. In signed contemporaneous statements he said he ‘did not contest’ the presence in his samples of numerous substances, cortisone included. His explanation was he didn’t know how they got there. Would Team Sky today, with a zero-tolerance policy, accept the rider’s explanation ‘I don’t know how it got there’ as a valid defence? Question 3 . Who are the three ‘independent world-class’ experts cited in Team Sky’s statement of March 7 who say the court documents are no proof of doping? Question 4 . The evidence provided last week by the MoS, and studied by these experts, was accepted as valid in a criminal court case where three defendants were given prison sentences in verdicts, never appealed. On what specific, scientific basis did these three experts reject this evidence? Question 5 . Dave Brailsford said on The Telegraph’s cycling podcast last week that the experts, paid by Team Sky, did not know Servais Knaven’s name when analysing the papers. Is it true the experts didn’t know the papers related to Knaven? (His name appears across the papers) If so, why not? Question 6 . Knaven explicitly told police in 1998 he had no medical conditions requiring treatment with prescription drugs, yet admitted use of one prescription drug, Persantin — a blood thinner — and tested positive for another, Naftidrofuryl. The latter is used by heart patients. Knaven said in 1998 he’d never heard of it, but now admits he used it. Why the apparent contradictions? Question 7 . Team Sky say they were unaware until last week of the contents of the police statements relating to Servais Knaven from 1998 and of various findings during that Tour, including products in his room and system. You now know about the court documents in Reims. Will you go to review them? Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "input_text": "Radical new proposals including law changes and possible punishments for team doctors are being drawn up in a bid to halt a shocking 900 per cent increase in reported concussions ahead of this year’s World Cup. High-profile incidents suffered by players during the current Six Nations — including Wales wing George North, England full-back Mike Brown and Ireland flanker Sean O’Brien — have reignited concerns over the extent of concussion in professional rugby and how the potentially fatal injury is handled. A recent RFU audit revealed reported rates of concussion were 59 per cent higher during the 2013-14 Aviva Premiership season than the previous year, with 10.5 concussions occurring every 1,000 player hours. Full-back Mike Brown suffered a heavy blow to the head in England's victory over Italy . But figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show the rate of reported concussions for the current Six Nations stand at 25 per 1,000 player hours after three rounds — more than double the RFU’s figure and almost 10 times the number reported a decade ago. ‘It’s a massively high number and it’s causing significant concern across the sport,’ said one insider at the governing body, World Rugby. ‘Something needs to be done because the World Cup is coming up and the eyes of the world will be on rugby. Concussion is unquestionably the biggest issue facing the sport.’ Significant strides have been made by the sport’s governing bodies in recent times, with a compulsory education programme introduced in the Aviva Premiership at the start of this season and a gradual introduction of pitch-side video technology for medics to access. Brown was ruled out of Ireland game after failing stage three of the return to play concussion protocol – a process all players must undergo after suffering head injuries . World Rugby bosses, aware of potentially damaging long-term effects of multiple concussions to players and desperate to avoid potentially crippling legal action seen in the NFL, have also instituted an extensive education programme. And they are in the processes of drawing up a legally binding document to ensure strict player welfare guidelines are adhered to at the World Cup. But there are fears the current measures do not go far enough and The Mail on Sunday understands World Rugby chiefs have agreed the introduction of further medical protocols ahead of the World Cup which include: . Wales admitted George North should have been removed from play after being knocked unconscious . Rugby union has been on high alert since the NFL agreed to pay out close to a billion dollars to more than 4,000 former gridiron stars with neurodegenerative conditions linked to multiple concussions and the latest figures will do little to ease concern. This week, World Rugby’s head of medicine Dr Martin Raftery presented to the world governing body’s executive committee when the proposal to draw up a worldwide group of players, coaches, referees, doctors and medics with a remit to look at law changes to reduce concussion rates was ratified. ‘We are now starting to understand the magnitude of the problem,’ said Dr Raftery. ‘If we had started the prevention programmes five years ago, we would have been saying, “We need to get it down from five [concussions per 1,000 hours]. Now we know it’s going to be at least 10.5 if not more and I think we’ll see another increase. We are getting far better compliance around concussion but we don’t believe we have finished this process. We’ve reached a baseline but we are not going to allow people to drop the ball in this area. If there’s an issue it will be referred to a disciplinary tribunal and we’ll investigate it.’ There was widespread criticism of the Wales medical team for failing to spot two incidents in which North appeared to be knocked unconscious but was allowed to play on. A World Rugby concussion panel — comprising Dr Raftery and some of the world’s leading brain injury experts — accepted the Welsh medical team’s explanation that they were unsighted for both incidents, although questions remain as to why no one among the team’s backroom staff, some with access to BBC broadcast footage, alerted the medics. ‘The Welsh didn’t have to co-operate but they were extremely co-operative,’ said Raftery. ‘They were also extremely embarrassed about what happened.’ Concerns also persist that so-called ‘independent’ match-day doctors in the Six Nations are often employees of the home union and therefore highly unlikely to challenge or even over-rule a team doctor if they believe a serious breach in protocol has occurred. ‘They will have to be fully independent match-day doctors at the World Cup,’ said Raftery. ‘Every other match day appointment is independent so why not doctors? Imagine if England were playing Australia and the match-day doctor was English and decided that Israel Folau should come off with 20 minutes left even if the Wallaby team doctors said he was fine. There would be absolute outcry. We have to avoid that scenario. ‘The match day doctor has the ability to over-rule team doctors but I’d hope they would look to work together.’ Exeter Chiefs have announced a new research programme to investigate effects of concussion on their players, while Saracens are also trialling micro-chip technology to assess the extent of forces their players are being exposed to.",

The teams drew 1-1 in Switzerland three weeks ago but goals by Yacine Brahimi, Miguel Herrera, Casemiro and Vincent Aboubakar settled the tie to send the Portuguese side into their first quarter-final since 2009. The one sour note on an otherwise perfect night for Porto was that captain Danilo had to be carried off on a stretcher with his neck in a brace, but it was later confirmed he had suffered no serious injury. Casemiro slides to his knees in celebration after finding the top corner with a stunning free-kick . Casemiro points the sky in celebration after firing Porto into a 3-0 lead on the night sealing the victory . Tomas Vaclik dives in vain as Casemiro's unstoppable strike flies into the top corner in Porto on Tuesday .

Booked: Gashi, Gonzalez, Safari . Sent off: Samuel . Manager: Paulo Sousa . Referee: Jonas Eriksson . Basle were reduced to 10 men in injury time after experienced defender Walter Samuel was dismissed for a second bookable offence for an off-the-ball incident with Aboubakar. Algerian midfielder Brahimi opened the scoring for the home side in the 14th minute with a superbly executed free kick after on-loan Barcelona forward Cristian Tello was clumsily felled right on the edge of the penalty area by former Inter Milan defender Samuel. Brahimi placed the ball with purpose before the 25-year-old sent a bending effort over the wall and into the top corner, leaving Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik rooted to the spot. Porto were then dealt a major blow as captain and Real Madrid  target Danilo was involved in a sickening collision with his own keeper Fabiano. The clash left both men in a heap but it was the Brazilian right back that came off worst. Danilo crashed to the floor, visibly knocked following contact with Fabiano's shoulder. The 23-year-old left the field on a stretcher with his neck in a brace before being placed in an ambulance and taken to hospital, where tests revealed no lasting damage. Yacine Brahimi opened the scoring for Porto with a brilliantly placed free kick in the 14th minute . Hector Herrera wheels away in celebration after giving Porto a 2-0 lead early in the second half . Cameroon striker Aboubakar falls to his knees as he celebrates his goal in front of the fans . After a lengthy stoppage in play Porto could have added to their lead in the first half as the Portuguese side controlled the game. First Casmeiro and then Aboubakar went close as the home side had to settle for a one-goal lead at half-time. But Porto did extend their advantage just minutes after the restart. Goalscorer Brahimi turned provider this time as he teed up Hector Herrera after a fine run down the left flank. Brahimi twisted and turned before cutting back to the Mexican on the edge of the area, who beat Vaclik with a perfectly placed curling effort from 18 yards. Algerian Brahimi lifted the ball over the Basle wall from the the edge of the box leaving the keeper rooted . It got even better for Porto as on-loan Real Madrid midfielder Casemiro produced a stunning free kick, a cut above even  his team-mate's in the opening 45. The 23-year-old struck a dipping effort from more than 30 yards that left poor old Vaclik picking the ball out the net again to put the tie beyond any doubt. The fourth goal, coming with 15 minutes to play, was just as good as the three that preceded it. Basle defenders backed off  Aboubakar as he marauded forward before the Cameroon international unleashed a ferocious strike from 20 yards that nestled in the top corner. Frustration boiled over for Samuel in the final moments of the match as he was involved in an altercation with Aboubakar off the ball. The Argentine defender was shown a second yellow card for his troubles as Porto marched into the last eight.

        "input_text": "Mexican cockfighting promoters on Friday kicked off an event billed as the largest exhibition of the bloodsport the country has ever seen. The annual Texcoco Horse Fair, which takes places on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, will see 16 nightly bouts of cockfighting over the space of a month – all of which end in the death of one of the animals. Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition despite demands to ban the 'disgusting' sport. Scroll down for video . Injured birds are given only 15 seconds to recover, even if they are incapable of fighting back, in the brutal cockfights staged nightly during the month-long Texcoco Horse Fair . Razorblades are attached to the birds' left leg to make the fights 'more interesting' for gamblers and trainers . Trainers often spit on a rooster's head in a common technique used to anger the bird before it fights . Trainers from all over the country compete not only for the title of best trainer, but also to keep alive what they claim is a proud Mexican tradition - even though the 'sport' has been met with furious protests . 'Cockfighting is deeply embedded in Mexico's rural culture', Texcoco tourism spokeswoman Rosalinda Benitez told MailOnline on the opening night of the month-long bloodsport bonanza. 'We want to showcase the proud tradition to our visitors'. The event, which includes fairground attractions and one of Mexico's biggest horse auctions, expects to receive more than 600,000 visitors over the month. 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', said Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year. 'This year they want to make clear how much the people love to come and watch quality cockfights'. While cockfighting is banned in all 50 US states and Europe (it was banned in England in 1835), it nevertheless draws big crowds in Mexico, where fans come to gamble on the fights and drink until the early hours of the morning. Male birds are vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers . 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later' The dominant bird at this stage of the fight has ripped away some feathers from his stricken opponent . Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another . A cock struts proudly in the ring, though it will only take one blow from a razor blade to strike him down . The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena before the fights . Cockfighting is also banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but the bloodsport is nevertheless extremely popular in more rural areas of the country. Indeed the cockfighting arenas, known as palenques, are often the social hubs of many Mexican towns. 'Cockfighting is a family business', said Gregory Castillo, a gamecock trainer from Ranchito Gaby, one of the eight gamecock-producing ranches competing on the fair's opening night. 'We get a good reception wherever we perform and people always come out to witness the spectacle. It always produces a good party atmosphere'. Gregory had already seen two of his prize gamecocks die against superior opponents that evening, and was engaged in strapping the curved razorblade of Mexican cockfighting regulation onto the left leg of his third bird. 'The razorblades make for more interesting fights', he told the MailOnline as he spat on the rooster's head, a common technique to anger the bird before it enters the battle. 'We train our animals to attack with their legs and feet first, and use the beak to finish the job later'. The cuurved weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena . Spatters of blood cover the floor of the cockfighting ring, surrounded by fans enjoying drinks and snacks . The cocks often scrap furiously on the floor of the arena, which is covered in blood from previous fights . 'Banning these events will never be accepted by the public', according to Jaime Rodriguez, a Texcoco resident who looks forward to the annual fair every year . The cockfighting areana, known as a palenque, in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration . The weapons attached to the birds' legs must be changed every five minutes in order to ensure they are not left blunted by the sand of the arena. 'It's a disgusting practice and there's no reason that it should continue simply because it's seen as tradition', said Leonora Esquivel, a leader of the AnimaNaturalis animal rights organisation, in a telephone interview with the MailOnline. Leonora's organisation, which works closely with Mexico's  Ecologist Green Party, is currently petitioning the government to put an end to animal cruelty in the country. The group focuses particularly on bullfights, cockfighting and illegal dogfights which occur periodically around the capital. Each cockfight runs for a maximum of 15 minutes, though most are over within two. Starting on the edge of the arena, the gamecocks are shown to one another, producing aggressive crowing, before being placed in their respective corners and let loose to attack one another. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws is rapid and furious. The male birds are extremely vicious and often emerge from the scuffles with their beaks filled with other's feathers. Even if a bird is injured and not attempting to fight any longer, it is permitted only a 15 second recovery period before being placed within a yard of its opponent and forced to continue. The flurry of feathers, beaks and claws, when it comes, is rapid and furious and fights are always to-the-death . The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome . 'Sometimes it comes down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over' A fight is declared over only when one of the birds is lying dead on the arena floor. The sport revolves entirely around gambling, and betting odds are always 2:1 on the fight's outcome. The gamecocks are displayed to the gamblers by being paraded around the circular arena, before being placed in front of a non-competitor mona ('monkey') gamecock to allow the gamblers to gauge their reactions. 'The more aggressively they peck, scratch and display their neck feathers at the mona, the more likely it is that they will be a good fighter', said Mauricio Alvarez, an observer in the crowd who had quadrupled his money over the previous two fights. 'But sometimes it comes completely down to luck. A weak bird might land a fatal blow with the razor and it's all over'. Bookmakers patrol the circular arena taking bets whenever a fight is not in progress. The high-rollers are always invited to seats within five rows of the arena and bookies' fees are negotiated depending on the size of the bets. The month-long Texcoco Horse Fair also features bullfighting and attracts more than 600,000 visitors a year . The facade of the main cathedral building in Texcoco (left). Mexico's national sport, charreria, is a kind of rodeo made up of different equestrian competitions and is also practiced at the fair (right) Cockfighting is banned within the limits of Mexico City, four cities in the state of Veracruz and Coahuila state on the Texas border, but is permitted in Texcoco, on the outskirts of the capital . For people further back in the stands, tennis balls with slits in them are thrown back and forth between gamblers and bookmakers: stuffed with stakes, winnings and losses. The palenque in Texcoco has a capacity of more than 3,000 people, and few seats were left unsold as the public clamoured to see the opening event of the month-long celebration. Following 16 cockfights, each ending with the bloodied loser unceremoniously dumped in a cement bucket, one of Mexico's most famous bands 'Los Angeles Azules' (The Blue Angels) took the animals' place to play to a packed house. The fair will culminate with three shows by Luis Miguel, one of Latin America's most famous artists and a Michael Bublé-esque crooner, from April 9 to 11. All the shows will follow directly on from the cockfights. In December of last year animal rights activists achieved a nationwide ban on the use of wild animals in circuses, imposing fines of up to £180,000 on organisations which cannot prove the domestic origins of any animals which are used in their performances. The Mexican government is currently engaged in the struggle to find homes for more than 2,000 repossessed tigers, lions, elephants and other such animals which have been freed as a result of the law. International supermarket chain WalMart was in trouble late last year as shoppers complained that a store in Veracruz state hosted a cockfight in order to promote a soft drinks company.",

        "input_text": "To get in touch with Martin, leave your comments below or send your tweets to @MailSport using #TackleKeown . Sportsmail columnist MARTIN KEOWN answered YOUR questions after an entertaining week in the Champions League and the FA Cup. Chelsea were knocked out by PSG on Wednesday night, with subjects ranging from the referee's performance, Zlatan Ibrahimovic's comments on the Blues being 'babies', David Luiz's return and whether the Premier League is still the best in the world. Also, Arsenal overcame their Old Trafford hoo-doo to beat Manchester United on Monday night, and the former Gunners legend was at the game. But what was that 'money' sign to Arsene Wenger all about? You can read all the answers below. Host commentator . It’s certainly a good way to sum it up. If you think about how you’d react in that situation, he didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry. He probably thought the referee had got it so wrong, and everyone could see it, that he’d get off the hook. The controlled reaction of the Chelsea players was definitely a factor in the red card. Many years ago, when I was playing under George Graham against United, he accused us of being too nice during half-time. He said we had to get around the referee as they were influencing every decision. From that day, I contested every decision, almost giving the referee a running commentary. I would often say, ‘who’s in charge, them or you?’. There’s nothing worse for a referee to hear. I appreciated why people don’t like to see it, but as well as influencing the referee, it makes you fight and compete for everything. It makes you more alive and puts your receptors on red alert. It’s like a game within a game, and believe me, it works. Niall came into the game quite late. As a youngster he did his A-levels and his club Reading helped him through. Just recently he’s turned a huge corner, particularly since Steve Clarke was appointed and started involving him in first-team training. Ireland asked about him last year, but he had an operation, which curtailed his development. Now he’s in the Under 21 squad and we’re very proud. It looks ironic, given that I played for England, but a lot of my family were shocked I didn’t play for Ireland as I come from a big Irish family. I could have played with as much passion for Ireland as I did for England, and it’s Niall’s right to play for Ireland, too. It was a clear demonstration from United that he’s not going to be a part of their future. We know he hasn’t played well, and he looks like he’s lost some sharpness because of his knee injury. Though his last contribution for United, winning a penalty against Sunderland, was very important and has been largely overlooked. He hasn’t played since! I think letting him go is probably the right call though. He’s not sharp enough, and doesn’t strike fear into the opposition. He looks to have given up trying to certain extent. I think Van Gaal is largely responsible for United’s situation at the moment though, not the players. Man management was Sir Alex Ferguson’s forte, and some players find it harder to cope than others. Mangers have to work with players’ minds, bodies and hearts. And when all is not right in their mind they will react to everything. It feels like Van Gaal has created this environment. Fergie would squeeze every ounce out of his players. If he were still there, they wouldn’t be so far away from top of league. I don’t blame either of them, Ben. They were shown the door, so why not? When Roman Abramovich first took over at Chelsea, he offered a lot of money for Thierry Henry, but Arsenal refused and Henry was flattered by it. I think Luiz would have been half-hoping for that same reaction from Chelsea. As for Welbeck, he’s a young man early in his career and was never really given a chance as a centre forward – his preferred role. And then there were the unnecessary comments from Van Gaal, claiming Welbeck was only good enough to be a substitute at United. He wanted to fulfill his dreams at United and he had to listen to that. Now he has the chance to fulfill his dreams with Arsenal. Everyone in the studio thought it was so funny. It’s like showing a montage of Gary [Lineker]'s misses! I was trying to explain that Andy Cole’s run takes me off Giggs’s line so I ended up caught in the middle. My most vivid memory is from after the game when I went into United dressing room to show some respect, but they were in full celebration mode and didn’t show a great deal of respect to us. I felt I had to say something though, it was an epic battle. But they weren’t better than us that day, put it that way... I had to have my smile surgically removed! It was fantastic. I must admit, I was surprised at how many of the young United fans in the ground wanted photos with me and autographs. They were very respectful. I had to walk through the United fans to get to the gantry, and it was a bit intimidating, but overall it was fine. Maybe, because the fans were so young, that hadn’t seen everything that used to go on! There was one occasion when I exclaimed out loud when Arsenal wasted a chance – that got a few comments from the crowd, but it was good to feel like part of my old club again. All credit to Luiz – he has so much self-belief. People were saying Mourinho was a genius for letting him go, but was he a genius last night, Calvin? Of course, he had to let him go for that kind of money. It’s just unfortunate for him that the player came back to demonstrate he was worth every penny. Though I must say, Thiago Silva was magnificent with those successive headers at the other end late on. You couldn’t have written a better script. David Luiz looks like the hero at his old ground, then Silva gives a horror penalty away but snatches the winning goal. It’s a valid argument, Jaymie. However, I think Chelsea’s performance has quite a lot to do with winning the Capital One Cup. I’ve never liked that trophy being awarded so early in season. It’s possible you’ll lose focus, making it tough to keep going. When Chelsea celebrated winning the cup I think they were also enjoying the fact that Manchester City had lost to Liverpool earlier in the day. They were probably thinking they had the league title wrapped up that weekend as well as the League Cup. That looks to have taken the edge off of them. They had a tough game against West Ham afterwards, and they were very lucky to get a result there. They look to have the wrong mentality. Money sign? We were talking about the grass! The Old Trafford pitch is part synthetic, part grass, which was a change sanctioned by David Moyes last season. We were remarking on how it compares to a normal grass pitch. I don’t think it makes it any less interesting, Nico, but whether it’s the best? I’m not even sure I thought it was best when Chelsea and Manchester United were in the Champions League final in 2008. Before Christmas, it looked like Chelsea and Real Madrid could win it. Suddenly there are huge question marks. It’s all about finding consistency and form at right time. The workload doesn’t help, but Chelsea had seven days to prepare. Routine is everything for footballers, and perhaps going from a game every three days to one a week might have affected them. Usually Chelsea control the tempo. They tried to press, but the likes of Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti were so calm and technically gifted... this forced the Chelsea players to sit off a bit as they couldn’t get the ball off them. PSG didn’t panic with ten men, they were brave and kept the ball in tight situations. They just ignored the fact they had 10 men, it was an incredible show of strength. It was like they had been hypnotised into thinking they had 11 men! Jose Mourinho was just as guilty as his team. Usually he’s very decisive – sending on three subs if he needs to – and gets it spot on. But he had them time wasting after they scored the first goal. They didn’t go out to win the match. Ibrahimovic goes to ground, realises he could make heavy contact and tries to pull away - I agree. Oscar knows exactly what he’s doing by feigning injury – it’s not nearly as bad as he makes out. I don’t think he should have been sent off, I’m not even sure it was a booking. The speed at which the Chelsea players all surround the referee is important – it’s the quickest you’ll ever see John Terry run! They can’t even be certain what’s happened or if their player is injured, but it doesn’t stop at least five or six of them waving their arms in air. It’s a calculated, orchestrated reaction, and they’ve been doing it for a while.",

Leading 2-1 from the last 16 first leg in Turin, the visiting side nullified Dortmund's attacking threat to leave Bayern Munich as the Bundesliga's only remaining side in the competition, with the final to be played in Berlin on June 6. It was Dortmund's fourth loss in four European games against Juventus. Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri had promised his side wouldn't sit back despite the first leg advantage. His players stayed true to his word and Tevez got the visitors off the mark with an effort that stunned the home fans. Juventus then pushed high up the pitch and snuffing out Dortmund's response before it could even begin. The home side harried and fought, yet was unable to trouble Gianluigi Buffon in goal. The veteran goalkeeper reacted quickly to extinguish the danger with Marco Reus lurking in the 36th but it was a rare intervention. Midfield marshal Paul Pogba had gone off injured before that, prompting a period of Dortmund pressure. The visitors were the only ones who created chances however, with Vidal firing over.

        "input_text": "There have been all manner of World Cup shambles for England since they should have won the 1992 final here in Australia. But never one as bad as this. This, surely, is the worst yet, worse than 1996 when Sri Lanka’s pinch-hitters left them trailing in their wake. Worse, even, than 1999 when England were eliminated from their own World Cup the day before the official song came out. And it is certainly worse than the last three World Cups when we had come to expect England to struggle in the one-day game, particularly in 2007 and last time when the biggest tournament in limited-overs cricket followed the Ashes.

England batsman Moeen lays on the ground after being run out by Bangladesh wicketkeeper Rahim during the World Cup match . The 15-run defeat here by Bangladesh at the Adelaide Oval, which confirmed England’s abject surrender, is nothing short of an utter humiliation, an embarrassment that, not for the first time in recent years, leaves them as the laughing stock of world cricket. This was the World Cup that England were supposed to take seriously and prepare thoroughly for. This was the World Cup that the Ashes were moved for, leading to a 5-0 thrashing last winter and all manner of painful recriminations. Yet so far advanced has the one-day game progressed in the last two years since England reached the Champions Trophy final that clearing the calendar and playing only one-day cricket so far this winter has been akin to trying to put a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. England have been able to defeat just Scotland in this tournament and after being thrashed by Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka they have now been humbled by a team in Bangladesh who are little more than minnows themselves. This tournament was set up to virtually guarantee the progress of the big eight teams to the quarter-finals. It was almost impossible for England to fail to at least get to the last eight where defeat would have been far from a disgrace. Or so it seemed. Instead this is a defeat that deserves to be considered as a total disgrace. It is one that leaves Peter Moores fighting to salvage his reputation as a credible coach of England and Paul Downton, the man who appointed him, facing huge questions about the big decisions he has made. When the dust settles and England have gone through the motions of their last group match against Afghanistan they must have a searching examination of how they play one-day cricket and how they can possibly catch up with the rest of the world before they host the next World Cup in four years time. It is not just Moores and Downton with much to contemplate. Senior players such as Ian Bell, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson have not provided the proper example needed from senior players in a young team and should retire from one-day cricket to allow a new young vibrant team to be built. And the decision to replace Alastair Cook with Eoin Morgan as one-day captain on the brink of this tournament has backfired, the new leader falling for his fifth duck in his last nine innings just when his team needed him most. Morgan has been given permission to miss England’s first one-day international after this World Cup, against an Ireland team having a far better tournament than England, so he can play in the Indian Premier League. That decision frankly stinks and if Morgan does not want to lead England into a new one-day era then he should give up the job now and let Joe Root, who was seriously considered when Cook was sacked, lead them from now on. Never mind that Jos Buttler almost rescued England after they had fallen to 163 for six chasing 275. And never mind that TV umpire Simon Fry gave an atrocious decision to rule that Chris Jordan had been run out when surely there was doubt over whether his bat had bounced up once he had made his ground.

Moores went into full Graham Taylor mode on the sidelines, raging at the fourth official after a truly awful decision, but in truth England did not deserve to get away with this. They were second best to a tigerish Bangladesh just as they have been worse than second best throughout this tournament. And it all started off so well too. It looked as though England were going to have an easy night when Anderson found the bite and swing that had eluded him in this tournament to take two wickets in his first seven balls. Neither Imrul Kayes nor Tamim Iqbal, the dangerman at the top of the Bangladesh order, could cope as England made a start full of the sort of aggression and purpose that the seriousness of their plight demanded. Yet England could not have expected the resistance and then blossoming strokeplay that came from a batsman who had never made a one-day international century before in Mahmudullah. The drop-in pitch at the re-built Adelaide Oval may have been near perfect for batting but the lack of variety in an England attack that has struggled for penetration in this World Cup allowed Bangladesh to flourish. Mahmudullah found a willing ally in the tiny form of Mushfiqur Rahim, the Bangladeshi ‘mighty atom’ who first faced England as a 16-year-old schoolboy 10 years ago, and together they preyed on England’s nerves. Mahmudullah certainly enjoyed becoming the first Bangladeshi to record a hundred in a World Cup match and while he and Rahim were adding 141 for the fifth wicket a total beyond 300 looked within his side’s reach. That they fell 25 short of that was down to much improved death bowling from England, Chris Jordan in particular showing how it should be done after being preferred to Steven Finn in this winner takes all match. It should have been well within England’s reach but their chase was old-fashioned and flawed with Bell, involved in a schoolboy run out that saw the demise of Moeen Ali, leaving them far too much to do after he had taken 82 balls to reach 63. The dismissals of Bell and Morgan in four balls from Rubel Hossain, faster than any England bowler, left England deep in the mire and even though Buttler, their main glimmer of hope for a better one-day future, hit 65 off 52 balls they ended up 16 short. The brilliant Hossain finished it by bowling both Broad and Anderson in three balls in the penultimate over, leaving Chris Woakes stranded on 42, to spark off wild Bangladeshi celebrations.

        "input_text": "Whoever agreed to schedule Aston Villa’s FA Cup quarter-final with West Bromwich Albion at 5.30 on a Saturday evening showed a dangerous lack of foresight. It seems nobody at the Football Association, the BBC, the clubs or West Midlands Police seriously considered that trouble might follow a day off work when fans of the two local rivals had all afternoon to drink. That miscalculation contributed significantly to scenes described by several former players as from the 1970s — pitch invasions, seats ripped out and used as weapons, players barged and forced to fight their way to the sanctuary of the dressing rooms. Police clash with unruly fans in  scenes reminiscent of the  of the 1970s following Aston Villa's FA Cup defeat of West Brom . West Brom players look concerned as Aston Villa fans invade the pitch at the end of their FA Cup quarter final . Aston Villa fans celebrate by racing on to the pitch following their 2-0 victory over West Brom at Villa Park . Fans of both Villa and West Brom behaved irresponsibly and have been condemned by their own clubs. Action will follow. But it is clear questions need to be asked about the way matches that carry the potential to be ‘tasty’, as Tony Pulis described this fixture, are arranged. In the past, police have insisted derbies kick off early in the day. In this instance, the local force claim it was out of their hands, with the decision down to the FA. Sources at English football’s governing body say scheduling is a collaborative effort, including police guidance. The wishes of broadcasters play a huge part and evening slots are good for ratings. It is the reason some Arsenal fans will find it impossible to get back to London from Manchester by train. Insufficient numbers of police and stewards attempted to deal with the hundreds who invaded the field of play . Police attempt to halt fans who ran on to the pitch after Aston Villa booked their place in the semi-finals . Villa fans leap over hoardings at the final whistle - while the decision to stage the game at 5.30pm is being questioned . But the BBC, who reportedly paid up to £120million for the rights to show the world’s oldest competition over four years, declined to accept responsibility. A spokesman said: ‘Both West Brom and Villa, along with the police, agreed to the kick-off time and raised no objections.’ If this was a ball rather than the buck, Villa boss Tim Sherwood would be pleased at how quickly it was being passed. Following the match, the national lead officer for football policing appeared on BBC Radio 5Live, and he questioned the decision to play the match on a weekend evening. 'Saturday night football is here to stay, we appreciate that, Friday night football is due to be coming in,' he said. West Brom manager had described the Midlands derby fixture as 'tasty' ahead of the game . West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill is mocked by an Aston Villa fan following the home side's second goal . 'When you have these fixtures you have to be careful about which ones you play. All games have potential (for crowd trouble) but clearly some games have more potential than others. 'They are big clubs, not clubs that particularly have a troublesome following but when you have that sort of fixture, late on a weekend in particular, alcohol is a factor. 'If you give people four, five, six hours more drinking time, don't be surprised if in a highly-charged atmosphere, their behaviour isn't good. 'Broadcasters as well as the football authorities need to start taking these issues seriously. 'What we want is a sensible dialogue so that we schedule the game appropriately. If you look at the four games for the FA Cup quarter-finals this week, you couldn't probably have picked a worse one to have on a Saturday tea-time than a local derby between two big clubs.' The West Brom goalkeeper attempts to make his way safely off the field following the full-time whistle . Scorer Scott Sinclair (second left) is mobbed by a fan and team-mates Ashley Westwood and Jack Grealish . Fans sing and chant on the pitch following Aston Villa's win during what has been a disappointing season . West Brom sources suggested the kick-off time did cause concern but no formal objection was made. Similar timings have been used before for derbies but with 6,500 West Brom fans travelling across town on Saturday — significantly more than usual — the risk of trouble was surely increased. Villa face the prospect of a fine in the region of £100,000 for failing to adequately control hundreds of fans who ran on to the pitch before referee Anthony Taylor blew for full-time. The top-end punishment would be a partial stadium closure. The FA have launched an investigation and will ask why only a dozen or so stewards were at the Holte End corner where Villa fans burst on to the pitch, causing a two-minute delay. There had been invasions after both goals and the final 60 seconds were played out with a mass of people congregated on the sidelines. Thousands spilled on when Villa’s win was confirmed. Many were in a celebratory mood, wishing to hug their players, even if first goalscorer Fabian Delph was inadvertently bitten by fans overly eager to plant a kiss. On this basis, pitch invasions have been previously celebrated. But there was a sinister undercurrent too. Many wanted to goad beaten opponents. Albion goalkeeper Boaz Myhill was repeatedly shoved in a confrontational manner. A group encircled him, filming on their mobiles. He picked one phone up and chucked it away. Aston Villa players Leandro Bacuna (centre) and Jack Grealish (right) are mobbed by fans after the game . Goalscorer Fabian Delph claims fans nicked his captain's armband as well as his left boot during the invasion . West Brom forward Callum McManaman is escorted off the field after a row with an Aston Villa fan . Callum McManaman had to be shepherded to safety after an altercation with a Villa fan left him shaken, while sub keeper Ben Foster had a finger pushed in his face. Even those who feel pitch invasions can joyously mark a momentous occasion must recognise the inherent danger of Saturday night. During the 93rd-minute surge those who remained in their seats booed loudly. Former Villa striker Stan Collymore said on talkSport: ‘Absolute disgrace, drunken yobs besmirching the name of Villa.’ Mark Lawrenson, commentating on the BBC, said: ‘There are not enough stewards at the Holte End. There are about 15. It’s like a scene from the 1980s all over again.’ An Aston Villa supporter is escorted off by stewards after invading the pitch before full time . Sinclair is crowded by Aston Villa supporters after scoring his goal in the 2-0 victory . There appeared to be almost three times as many stewards at the other end, forming a line in front of the North Stand housing West Brom fans above those supporting Villa. Those seating arrangements have been questioned after one fan was left with a bloody wound when a seat ripped from the tier above hit him on the head. Kevin Phillips, who played for both clubs, said: ‘Seeing those seats come down, it could kill someone. Those people should be found and banned.’ A West Brom statement read: ‘The club is aware of reports of serious misbehaviour involving some of its own supporters. It issues an uncompromising reminder that any supporter found guilty of disorder can expect the appropriate sanction from the club. We will continue to operate zero tolerance to any fans who bring the club’s reputation into disrepute.’ Privately, West Brom were perplexed about the seating arrangements. A match against fierce rivals from across town, finishing as night descended, was always going to carry an edge. Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood admitted he could understand the fans' emotions after the victory . The pitch at Villa Park can barely be seen s supporters cover practically every blade of grass . Also of concern will be coins thrown at Craig Gardner as he took corners. West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace is said to have left Villa Park in a rage. No injuries have been reported to West Midlands Police, who said 17 arrests had been made for public order as well as drunk and disorderly offences. Chief Superintendent Chris Johnson said a probe had also been launched to identify people involved in a disturbance before the match at the Witton Arms pub, down the road from Villa Park. Stadium CCTV will be studied as will any footage obtained from the police helicopter. But those investigating should look at themselves. Aston Villa fans celebrate victory on the pitch after what has been a highlight of a lacklustre season . Aston Villa supporter Mark Villers needed his hair cut and wound glued together on Saturday night .",

        "input_text": "Sixty three seconds was all it took. Just over one minute was enough for a game to be turned on its head and for refereeing standards to be demonstrated, once again, to be lamentable. To deal with the first part of that conundrum, referee Neil Swarbrick can’t really be blamed for the game ending as a spectacle before it had even got going. Gareth McAuley and Craig Dawson got themselves in a terrible tangle, the former with a sloppy pass and the latter clumsily challenging Wilfried Bony, who was through on goal. The red card was justifiable and the challenge was a bone-headedly stupid one to make in the first minute. The real drama occurred thereafter, however. Bony, to his credit, attempted to go on and score. McAuley, attempting to redeem his error, ran round to challenge the Ivorian and make a good challenge to block him. Referee Neil Swarbrick shows a red card to Gareth McAuley (right) during the second minute of West Brom's match at Manchester City. But it was Craig Dawson who committed the original foul on Wilfried Bony as the striker tried to break through on goal . West Brom defender Craig Dawson makes the original challenge on Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony just outside the penalty area . The Ivorian striker heads to the ground under Dawson's clumsy challenge but managed to regain his balance and continue . Bony continues but Gareth McAuley then comes in with a challenge of his own from the opposite angle inside the area . Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge, leading to the dismissal of the West Brom player . Bony heads to the Etihad Stadium turf after being challenged by McAuley as the ball runs clear . Swarbrick brandishes a straight red card to a bemused McAuley after just 89 seconds of the match . West Brom players Darren Fletcher and Jonas Olsson protest as Swarbrick shows McAuley the red card . BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . Baggies boss Tony Pulis doesn't look at McAuley as he makes his way back to the dressing rooms at the Etihad Stadium . As this sign at the Etihad Stadium confirms, McAuley's sending off was the fastest in the Premier League this season at 89 seconds .

Click here for our match zone service . In the midst of all that, Swarbrick blew up for a foul from where Dawson had made the initial challenge. But instead of sending off the left back he dismissed McAuley. In one year the Premier League has now seen three cases of the wrong man being sent off. Either referees are getting worse, or the game is getting immeasurably faster. And with rugby’s Six Nations tournament reaching a climax yesterday, you longed for a brief pause in which the referee could consult a fourth official who could adjudicate on the red card – he would have probably concurred – and then ensure the right man is sent off. Tony Pulis naturally agreed with that, arguing managers should have the ability to challenge two decisions in a match, citing the fact that in other games Dawson’s challenge might have gone unpunished. ‘The inconsistency is one thing,’ he said. ‘But once he decides it’s a goal-scoring opportunity and he has to send him of I can’t believe he’s picked the wrong player. It’s beyond me. Pellegrini’s assessment was about correct. ‘He made a mistake about the player but I think the rule is very clear,’ he said. ‘The chance was very clear and he was the last man. Then it doesn’t depend on the referee – he has to do what the rule says.’ Naturally the match felt unnaturally uncompetitive thereafter and that seemed to be reflected in the crowd. The atmosphere at City after a week of defeats to Burnley and Barcelona was as muted as could be. Technically they are still in the title race; in fact they are only three points behind, albeit Chelsea have two games in hand. But judging from the mood at The Etihad yesterday, that is merely a theoretical, abstract concept. All belief seems to have been sucked out of the club, meaning that all that is left is a top-four finish to oversee before Pellegrini is thanked for his time and his two trophies. Wilfried Bony celebrates after scoring Manchester City's first goal after 25 minutes at the Etihad Stadium . The Ivorian striker opened his account for the club when he spun inside the box, hooked the ball over and fired into the net . Fernando gets down on his knees to celebrate scoring City's second goal five minutes before half-time . The Brazilian pounced from close range following Baggies defensive confusion, with goalkeeper Boaz Myhill grounded . David Silva (centre) is congratulated after scoring City's third goal to make absolutely sure of the three points . Silva raises his arms in celebration after touching in a shot by Stevan Jovetic from the edge of the penalty box . There was a brief spell in which you wondered if Pellegrini’s woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten-man West Brom. But the visitors, Boaz Myhill aside, weren’t in the mood for gritty defiance. Indeed, it seemed as though the entire fiasco had collectively scrambled their defensive brains. The first two goals they conceded, which made their task hopeless both came from corners, situations at which they should be able to defend more easily than from open play. But for the first goal on 26 minutes, City worked the ball well from a short corner to Wilfried Bony. Craig Gardner attempted a half hearted challenge but Bony was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down; the unfortunate Dawson was also culpable, not reacting quick enough as the Ivorian controlled, shot and scored his first goal for the club since his £28m move. West Brom might have felt a little more aggrieved for the second goal on 40 minutes – though it too involved some dreadful defending. Jesus Navas corner was met by the high, flying foot of Eliaquim Managala and it seemed perilously close to Stephane Sessegnon’s head. That said, from thereon in, West Brom hardly covered themselves in glory. Jonas Olsson sliced the ball gently into the path of Fernando and James Morrison failed to react as the Brazilian simply poked the ball into the net. Joe Hart collides with West Brom defender Jonas Olsson as he comes out to try and punch the ball clear . Joleon Lescott leaps in behind Pablo Zabaleta but sends the ball over Joe Hart's goal following a rare West Brom attack . Saido Berahino somehow hit the crossbar with this header, with Joe Hart nowhere near it . ‘I think our fans believe we can do it,’ said Pellegrini. ‘The important thing is to demonstrate playing the way we did today that we will try. That is very important.’ That they did, with 46 shots on goal. But it’s not enough to sustain credibility at present. There was a brief spell in which you wondered if Pellegrini’s woes might get worse should they fail to break down ten-man West Brom. But the visitors, goalkeeper Boaz Myhill aside, weren’t in the mood for gritty defiance. Indeed, it seemed as though the entire fiasco had collectively scrambled their defensive brains. For the first goal on 26 minutes, City worked the ball well from a short corner to Wilfried Bony. Craig Gardner attempted a half-hearted challenge but Bony was not to be shrugged off the ball and pulled it down; and the unfortunate Dawson was also culpable, not reacting quick enough as the Ivorian controlled, shot and scored his first goal for the club since his £28m move. The England under 21 striker can't quite believe his luck after seeing his header rebound off the woodwork . Frank Lampard rues a missed opportunity as City attempted to boost their goal difference - settling for three in the end . Man City striker Stevan Jovetic appeals to referee Swarbrick for a handball decision . Were it not for Myhill the afternoon would have been even more calamitous. His most notable saves came from David Silva on 23 minutes, 54 minutes and 59 minutes but that was by no means an exhaustive list. West Brom were also saved on 58 minutes by the post when Sergio Aguero struck and then again by the woodwork, when Bony chipped the rebound on to the cross bar. On 73 minutes there was an extraordinary development; a West Brom corner, which was flicked on by Olsson to Berahino, who, just two yards out, flicked an instinctive header on to the bar. The miss summed up a dismal afternoon. Shortly afterwards, Silva, by far the best player on the pitch, confirmed the inevitable. Stevan Jovetic combined well with the rampaging Gael Clichy and the Montenegrin’s shot was turned in at close range by Silva, who departed shortly after to a standing ovation. Still, the overwhelming feeling from both sides was of a season gently winding down rather than reaching a dramatic climax. West Brom's Chris Baird and Manchester City's Sergio Aguero compete for the bouncing ball . West Brom captain Darren Fletcher manages to win the ball from City striker Wilfried Bony .

        "input_text": "Administrators at a Catholic university in Florida agreed to help an honors student start a campus club that would send money and supplies to the ISIS terror army. Hidden camera footage released Monday morning shows officials and faculty at Barry University advising a senior – identified only as 'Laura' – about the best way to secure funding for a club she called 'Sympathetic Students in Support of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.' 'I want to start fundraising efforts on campus, and what I want to do is raise funds to send overseas,' she told Derek Bley, the school's Coordinator for Leadership Development and Student Organizations. Bley offered to help her create the organization and agreed with her request to 'pass out Islamic State flags and educate people' at an annual student 'Festival of Nations' fair. The video is from Project Veritas, a conservative 'guerilla film-making group' that last week captured a Cornell University dean agreeing that ISIS and Hamas would be welcome at the Ivy League school. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . When an honors student at Barry University in Florida asked campus administrators about getting college funds for a club supporting the ISIS terror army, her idea was met with approval . The Barry professor in charge of the undergraduate honors program agreed to serve as the pro-ISIS group's faculty advisor after hearing that its mission would include 'raising money and sending it to the Islamic State' 'We're not here to limit people,' Derek Bley, 'leadership development' coordinator, told 'Laura' as the student filmed him with a hidden camera . Barry University, based in Miami Shores, has received more than $112 million in federal grants and contracts, and another $109 million from Florida taxpayers since 2000, Project Veritas said Monday, citing figures from OpenTheBooks.com. It also once received tuition money from retired NBA great Shaquille O'Neal, who graduated in 2012 with a doctorate in Education. His final 'capstone project' – a load-lightened version of a doctoral dissertation – focused on 'humor and seriousness in leadership styles,' according to the Miami New Times. The school's mission statement says 'all members of our community' must 'accept social responsibility to foster peace and nonviolence.' Yet Bley was enthusiastic about Laura's terror-funding venture. 'We're not here to limit people and their clubs, he said. 'If there a demand or a need, or an interest that students have to do this, we're here to support that.' 'If you've got ... people who are interested, and this is something you want take and run with,' he added. 'we're here to help you get that done.' 'WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT THAT': Bley explained that his office wouldn't make judgments about the kinds of activities and clubs college students wanted to sign up for . The only objection? Asking students to support a group with 'ISIS' in its name, a multicultural program coordinator thought, might hold the organization back – so why not rename it? Laura put the murderous ISIS army's credentials front-and-center. 'They are terrorists,' she told Bley, 'but, like, we're trying to help them. We're trying to, like, educate them and give them funding so that they don't have to be impoverished and get involved in acts of violence.' 'You should create jobs and help promote education in the Islamic State,' she added later, 'because that's what helps reduce terrorism.' That was a subtle jab at U.S. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf, who said last month on MSNBC that 'we cannot kill our way out of this war' with ISIS.' The Obama administration, Harf said, should instead 'go after the root causes that lead people to join these groups' – including 'lack of opportunity for jobs.' At one point Laura expanded her fictional club's mandate to include providing paper and pencils to the 'widows and orphans' of dead ISIS jihadis. Barry University is a Catholic institution founded in 1940; its enrollment includes more than 9,000 students, about half of whom are undergrads like Laura . CAMPUS COLLABORATORS: Barry University administrators Derek Bley (left) and Frederique Frage (center), and professor Pawena Sirimangkala, helpfully counseled an undercover investigator about how to start a pro-ISIS student club . FLY THE FLAG: Laura was told her fictional pro-ISIS group would be allowed to pass out ISIS flags and 'educate' people during a campus 'Festival of Nations' event . FAMOUS ALUMNUS: Shaquille O'Neal earned an Education doctorate in 2012 . Another part of her pitch to college officials was a mission that included providing flashlights to ISIS fighters and their families. 'A lot of the facilities have been destroyed' in Iraq and Syria, she said, 'so there is not a lot of electricity and power.' 'A lot of the fighters, they can't see at night, you know?' she continued. 'So, like, people are attacking them and they can't see at night. And because they are so poor, like, they don't have night vision and stuff.' Bley explored the idea, speculating about the 'thousands of dollars' it might cost to send 'bulk shipments' of flashlights to the Middle East, 'like the ones at Costco and stuff.' The only objection Laura encountered was related to the group's proposed name. 'The only thing, as far as the name [goes],' she heard from Frederique Frage, the university's associate director of international and multicultural programs, is that 'technically our country is at war with ISIS'. Frage was quick to add: 'I am not saying that – at all – ISIS represents Islam.' But students might have 'some reservation' supporting a group engaged in a 'humanitarian effort' aimed at the terror group, she said. 'It's just unfortunate.' Another multicultural program administrator, Daisy Santiago, chimed in that Laura should rename her group 'Students in Support of the Middle East' – 'as opposed to having the 'ISIS' [name].' Project Veritas has already stung a Cornell University dean who said on camera that the Ivy League school would welcome an ISIS 'freedom fighter' who wanted to run a training camp . JOBS FOR JIHADIS? State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf insisted in February on MSNBC that an employment program in the Iraq and Syria could stem the tide of ISIS . A professor who runs the university's honors program later agreed to serve as the pro-ISIS club's faculty advisor. Laura explained that despite a less focused name that didn't include any mention of terror groups, her organization's mission would remain 'raising money and sending it to the Islamic State.' Professor Pawena Sirimangkala responded: 'I'll sign. I'm glad to do it.' Laura, an email from a Barry University administrator confirms, is set to receive an award on Monday from the school, as the 'outstanding senior in the Communication Department.' In December the Corporation for National and Community Service, a federal government agency, named Barry University to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. The distinction acknowledges universities that place a premium on community service efforts. Daily Mail Online has contacted the university staff named in the video and has not received a comment from them. In a statement provided to Daily Mail Online by the university, Scott Smith, vice president for student affairs, said, 'There has been no formation of an ISIS-related humanitarian aid group at Barry University' and that ' no paperwork' has 'ever' been filed to create such an organization. 'If a student or students are interested in forming a recognized student organization, they are advised on the established processes to follow for approval,' Smith stated. 'However, submitting a request does not guarantee approval since the purpose of all student groups must be in accordance with Barry University’s Mission Statement and Core Commitments. 'Barry University would not approve any group supporting a terrorist organization.'",

        "input_text": "Referee Neil Swarbrick has apologised for wrongly sending off West Brom's Gareth McAuley during his side's 3-0 loss at Manchester City. McAuley was a victim of mistaken identity when he was shown a red card after Craig Dawson fouled Wilfried Bony in the second minute of the Barclays Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium. Swarbrick has now admitted to his error in a statement from Professional Game Match Officials Ltd, the organisation responsible for refereeing appointments. Referee Neil Swarbrick shows a red card to Gareth McAuley (right) during the second minute of West Brom's match at Manchester City. But it was Craig Dawson who committed the original foul on Wilfried Bony . West Brom defender Craig Dawson makes a challenge on Manchester City striker Wilfried Bony . The Ivorian striker tumbles to the ground under Dawson's challenge . BT Sport showed the incident from referee Swarbrick's perspective, with No 25 Dawson the closest to him . Bony continues but Gareth McAuley then comes in with a challenge of his own inside the area . Bony goes to ground again under McAuley's challenge and the West Brom player is sent off . Bony heads to the Etihad Stadium turf after being challenged by McAuley . The West Brom players protest as McAuley is shown the red card by referee Swarbrick . 1 McAuley loses the ball inside his own half, with striker Wilfried Bony now bearing down on goal . 2 Craig Dawson comes across and makes the tackle, sending Bony crashing to the ground . 3 Referee Neil Swarbrick steps in, blowing his whistle to stop play . 4 But Bony has picked himself up quickly and continues to run with the ball into the penalty area, clearly not having heard the whistle . 5 McAuley then comes back to put in another tackle on the City striker . 6 Play finally stops and Swarbrick beckons a player across to him. Dawson does not move, however, putting his hands on his leg . 7 Instead, McAuley walks across to the referee and is then shown the red card . 8 McAuley can be seen saying 'it wasn't me' as players surround the referee. But their protests are to no avail . The statement read: 'In the second minute of Manchester City v West Bromwich Albion, referee Neil Swarbrick made a decision to send off Gareth McAuley for a 'denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity' offence. 'The referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player, which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity. The referee has apologised for his error.' Swarbrick left the West Brom players stunned and manager Tony Pulis livid after showing McAuley a straight red card when Dawson had committed the original offence. McAuley's sending off left West Brom with 88 minutes to hold out against City with just 10 men . McAuley was seen mouthing the words 'it's not me' to referee Swarbrick but it wasn't enough to change the decision. At half-time, Swarbrick admitted to BT Sport that the first number he saw after the incident was McAuley's No 23, leading to the case of mistaken identity. Speaking on BT Sport at half-time, pundit Steve McManaman said: 'It's just a simple case of mistaken identity. The decision is right, Wilfried Bony is through and he's denied a goalscoring opportunity. It's a red card. The two players mistaken by referee Swarbrick - McAuley (left) and Dawson (right) McAuley walks past his manager Tony Pulis as he leaves the field . 'It's a simple thing for the referee, Neil Swarbrick, he's just sent the wrong man off. He's sent McAuley off, he should have sent Dawson off. One's No 25, the other's No 23. Easy enough.' Owen Hargreaves added: 'Dawson's head is down initially because he think he's getting sent off. He just calls the players over, he doesn't call anybody specific. 'In the end, McAuley comes over rather than Dawson. In that situation, Dawson should be holding his hands up. It's a case of mistaken identity. It's a shame really because it's killed the game.' Because Wes Brown's sending off in Sunderland match at Old Trafford three weeks ago was a case of mistaken identity, both he and John O'Shea got away with bans. When asked whether the challenge warranted a red card, David James said: 'Absolutely, he's the last defender. Bony is through one-on-one with the referee, it's definitely a red card.' The red card was shown just 89 seconds into the match at the Etihad Stadium, leaving West Brom with a mountain to climb against the defending champions. Roger East sent off Sunderland's Wes Brown instead of  John O'Shea after a foul on Radamel Falcao. Baggies players Darren Fletcher, James Morrison and Craig Gardner were seen protesting to Swarbrick as the players left the field for half-time, but to no avail. With 88 minutes to hold out with 10 men, the Baggies lasted 25 until Bony spun inside the box and fired home his first for the club. Fernando doubled their advantage five minutes before the break, smashing home after West Brom failed to clear a corner. And David Silva made absolutely sure 13 minutes from the end, turning home Stevan Jovetic's shot with a faint touch. Brown is given his marching orders during the match at Old Trafford despite the fact it was O'Shea . The former Liverpool player and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher wrote on Kicca: 'Another case of mistaken identity in a sending off in today's game at the Etihad. Referees need help! 'We need technology in the biggest sport in the world!! How long do we have to wait? 'Goal line technology has helped the game but came too late. I would start with mistaken identity for red/yellow cards a monitor for the fourth official or the match assessor upstairs to help one of their colleagues. 'The referee must know from the players reaction he's made a mistake but can't be seen to change his decision that must surely affect the rest of his performance? Last season Andre Marriner wrongly showed Kieran Gibbs a red card when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handled . Gibbs is sent off by referee Marriner during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Arsenal . 'We can then see how far we can take technology but we have to start somewhere. West Brom won't have anyone suspended now either!' It is the second such incident in Manchester in the space of three weeks. On February 28, referee Roger East mistakenly sent off Sunderland's Wes Brown rather than John O'Shea after a foul on Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao. And last season, Andre Marriner wrongly showed Kieran Gibbs a red card when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handled on the line in Arsenal's 6-0 defeat at Chelsea. Gibbs appeals to Marriner after receiving a red card during the  match at Stamford Bridge .",

A hat-trick just three days after your first ever England call-up? You simply could not write it. But Kane is composing his own scripts at the moment. His dream season continued on Saturday as he fired Tottenham to a hard-fought victory. All this in front of England manager Roy Hodgson. Kane will surely make his England debut in either Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania or the friendly against Italy a few days later after taking his season tally of goals to 29. Harry Kane put Tottenham 3-2 ahead form the penalty spot after Danny Rose was fouled in the box as the 21-year-old completed his hat-trick . Kane holds three fingers up as he celebrates after scoring from the spot to score his first Premier League hat-trick . The strike was Kane's 29th goal of the season and the 19th in the Premier League as he overtook Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa . Tottenham were awarded the spot kick when Danny Rose was bundled over by David Nugent's clumsy challenge . England manager Roy Hodgson was watching form the stands as Kane became the Premier League's leading goalscorer . Kane applauds the Tottenham supporters as he takes the match ball after the final whistle at White Hart Lane . Tottenham: Lloris 5 (Vorm 4, 5); Walker 5, Dier 5, Vertonghen 5, Rose 6; Mason 7 (Dembele 87), Bentaleb 7.5; Townsend 6 (Paulinho 58, 6.5), Eriksen 7, Chadli 6; Kane 8.5 .

Referee: Mike Dean 6 . Harry Kane made it 2-0 with a deflected shot. Click here for more from MATCH ZONE . ‘It’s true he’s in a very good moment in career. He’s at the top,’ said Mauricio Pochettino. Tottenham’s victory came at a cost, though, with Hugo Lloris taken to hospital on Saturday after suffering a nasty gash to his knee in a collision with team-mate Kyle Walker and Jamie Vardy in the first minute. You could sense the worry in White Hart Lane as the Frenchman received lengthy treatment before being replaced by Michel Vorm. The mood picked up, though, as Spurs took a fifth-minute lead. No prizes for guessing who scored. Eric Dier’s flick from Christian Eriksen’s corner was parried by Leicester goal keeper Kasper Schmeichel and the rebound fell to Kane who tapped home. It was one of the simplest goals he’ll score — not that Kane cared an iota as he wheeled off in celebration. Jeff Schlupp scored an unfortunate own goal after Kasper Schmeichel's save rebounded off his chest and into the net to make it 4-2 . David Nugent reduced the deficit back to one in the 90th minute but Tottenham hung on to claim the three points . Leicester captain Wes Morgan thumps a powerful header past Michel Vorm to draw the visitors level after a Matty James corner . Morgan roars with celebration as he rushes towards the travelling Leicester supporters after equalising for Nigel Pearson's side . Jamie Vardy sucks his thumb in celebration after pulling a goal back for Leicester after 38 minutes at White Hart Lane on Saturday . David Nugent’s audacious attempt to catch Vorm off his line in the 10th minute nearly pulled the visitors level before Kane notched again in the 12th minute after a huge piece of fortune. Walker and Andros Townsend combined brilliantly down the right to fire a low cross into the area. Robert Huth’s attempted clearance fell to Kane, whose first-time strike took a big deflection off the German before bouncing past the luckless Schmeichel. Leicester did not deserve to be on the receiving end of this clinical Kane show after a promising start. It was nearly game over in the 22nd minute as Eriksen struck Schmeichel’s far post before Nacer Chadli wasted the rebound. Pochettino was looking to his bench again six minutes later after Dier was caught by Vardy’s arm. The England Under 21 defender carried on, albeit with a painful lump on his right cheek. But while Dier was showing great heart, the same couldn’t be said of his team-mate Chadli, who was booked for diving after falling in the box under pressure from Wes Morgan in the 36th minute. Two minutes later Leicester worked themselves a deserved lifeline as Nugent sprung through Tottenham’s left-side before providing an inch perfect cross for Vardy, who cooly fired home with an excellent one-touch finish. Vardy slides in to finish past Vorm from close range after a wonderful ball in from David Nugent as Leicester halved the deficit . Kane's deflected shot deceives Kasper Schmeichel and flies into the top corner as Tottenham raced into a two-goal lead after 13 minutes . Kane finds the net fro his 28th goal of the season just two days after he was named in Roy Hodgson's England squad for the first time . Kane gave Spurs an early lead when he tapped home from close range after Schmeichel could only parry Eric Dier's flick . The visitors could easily have pulled themselves level before the break, Nugent and Leonard Ulloa wasting good chances. Pochettino was desperate to get his team into the dressing room, but his half-time talk made no difference as Leicester levelled five minutes after the restart — Morgan ghosting into the area undetected to head home Matty James’ corner. Ten minutes later Leicester should have been ahead when Huth was presented with a golden chance to redeem himself following his role in Spurs’ second goal. Somehow he didn’t take it, sending a free header from another James corner wide. Leicester midfielder Esteban Cambiasso could do nothing to stop Kane's effort from close range finding the back of the net . Kane leads the celebrations after opening the scoring for Mauricio Pochettino's side at White Hart Lane on Saturday . Tottenham were dealt an early blow when Hogo Lloris left the field on a stretcher after a second-minute collision with Kyle Walker . The France goalkeeper looks to be in severe pain as he is seen to by the Tottenham medic following the early clash with the Spurs right back . At the time it seemed a pivotal moment, and so it proved as Spurs were handed a contentious penalty in the 62nd minute. Nugent thought he had time in the box, but Danny Rose had other ideas, nipping in front of the forward. He clumsily collided with the Spurs defender, who fell to the ground. In fairness to Nugent, the defender looked to go down easily but Mike Dean pointed to the spot. Leicester coach Kevin Phillips was soon shaking his head at fourth official Darren Bond after racing down the tunnel to watch a replay. The commotion didn’t concern Kane, though, as England’s newest recruit sent Schmeichel the wrong way to complete his hat-trick. Spurs had their fourth in the 85th minute, the unlucky Jeff Schlupp diverting the ball into his own net after Schmeichel foiled Eriksen. That should had seen Spurs home without fuss but Nugent set up a nervy three minutes after some poor Jan Vertonghen defending, to score Leicester’s third.

        "input_text": "A broken neck would have put paid to most men's hopes of achieving anything in life, but instead it drove Warrick Brant on to becoming Australia's strongest man. Warrick, whose sister Lauren appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here earlier this month, suffered the traumatic accident playing rugby union when he was only 20 years old. The future had initially looked bright for the young prop who presented Australia at under-19 and under-21 level in 1998 and 1999. But after playing a year professionally in England for Bedford, disaster struck when he returned to Australia and broke his neck in pre-season scrum training with the Queensland Reds. Scroll down for video . Australia's strongest man Warrick Brant overcame a broken neck to fulfil his dreams . Warrick meets the world's most famous bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. He met the action star at the Arnold Strongman Classic in Columbus, Ohio, a fortnight ago . Pulling a large truck is much easier than it seems according to Warrick . It could not have come at a worse time as the following weekend he was due to train with the Australian national front-row training squad in Canberra. ‘It happened at scrum training. It was just one of those things – an unfortunate training accident,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I was in hospital for about a month and had two surgeries. I was in a neck brace for six months.’ The road to recovery was a long one. Just being able to drive his car again was a big ask, but it could have been worse. Fed up with bodybuilding he began competing in strongman events to better utilise his training . Warrick competes in the World's Strongest Man competition in Los Angeles last year. In this event he had to pull two trucks -the blue and maroon one behind are tied together - along a strip of road. Warrick holds his sister Lauren above his head at an event to raise funds for the McGrath Foundation in Brisbane. Lauren recently appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . ‘When I first got injured I could not use my right arm at all because I’d lost all my feeling in it. I couldn’t even eat my dinner; I had to use my left hand all the time. It was a pretty tough time,’ he explained. The physical suffering he endured though was nothing compared to the mental anguish he went through at the time. ‘It’s not just the loss of a sport that you’ve loved all your life, but it’s the loss of a potential income as well,' Warrick told Daily Mail Australia. 'Professional rugby was thriving, especially in England, and I thought I was set for life. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. In this event at the World's Strongest Man competition in Los Angeles last year Warrick has to throw kegs of different weights over a bar five metres in the air . ‘I don’t think I’ve ever got over it. I wouldn’t say I’m bitter but I’m still disappointed. I’m now working flat out and struggling to pay bills, which is the complete opposite to what I would have had if I’d been a professional rugby player. ‘But I have to remind myself that it could have been much worse and I may not have been able to even walk, so I have to constantly remember that.’ Contact sport was now out for Warrick. He soon put on a huge amount of weight and didn’t know what to do with himself until a friend came up with an idea – why not try bodybuilding? After moving into powerlifting in 2005 he set an Australian record in the discipline . ‘I had become depressed and was eating everything in sight. My weight ballooned,’ he said. ‘But my friend got me back in the gym training again and a year later persuaded me to get on stage and compete in the Queensland Bodybuilding Championships. ‘It was the best thing I could have done and my confidence started coming back.’ But after a year of this Warrick realised that what he enjoyed was the strength side of training rather than the appearance. The Atlas Stones is one of strongman's signature events. Here Warrick raises one off the floor. The stones range in weight from 140-200 kilos. Instead of showing people his toned body he wanted to show them how strong he was. He did this by lifting massive weights in the gym to start with, before moving into powerlifting where in 2005 he set an Australian record in the discipline. It was a simple transition after that to start competing in strongman competitions. ‘I always watched them on TV growing up. It was great to watch because they were big and strong, but they were also amazing athletes,’ Warrick said. The fact that competitors were great athletes as well as being immensely strong was what attracted Warrick to taking part in the events . Warrick first competed in America’s Strongest Man in 2008 and 2009. The rest as they say is history. Last year he won the Southern Hemisphere’s Strongest Man title in Melbourne and Australia’s Strongest Man crown. He is also the only Australian to make the final of the World’s Strongest Man competition. Unfortunately a muscle tear will rule him out of the 36th year of the World’s Strongest Man competition later this month in Malaysia, but he has nothing to prove at this stage. He has pulled and lifted airplanes, trucks and buses over the years. But it's apparently easier than it sounds. Warrick puts much of his success down to his wife Bethany who also acts as his nutritionist and physiotherapist . ‘You can’t really train for it. You can’t go up to an airport and asked them to pull one of their planes. But funnily enough it’s not the hardest thing to do,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘It’s more like conditioning work.

Generally she does her workouts with her fiancée Warren. ‘Lauren trains at my gym every day and is into general fitness. She trains there with Warren regularly. All my family is into sport in some way or another. We’ve got a very athletic background,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. The 35-year-old trains four times a week for three hours each session doing a variety of weights regimes that will depend on the kind of strongman competition he'll be competing in. Generally he weighs in at between 145-150 kilos. Warrick attributes much of his success to his wife Bethany who is a former bodybuilder too. She has travelled with him to strongman competitions across the globe. ‘She acts as my trainer, my nutritionist, and my physiotherapist. She always makes sure I’m in perfect condition for every event,’ he said. Warrick's story proves that with dedication and perseverance you can still achieve your goals . The couple had their first baby, a girl called Indiana, in December. And it sounds like she also has her father’s fighting spirit. ‘She was born premature and arrived seven weeks early. She was three weeks in hospital in the Intensive Care Unit, but she’s all healthy now and doing well,’ Warrick said.",

The Cincinnati Bengals star wrote that 4-year-old Leah, who has been bravely battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma for the past year, may finally be free of the disease. 'That moment you get the best news you've ever received and don't know what to do so you just flex!!' wrote Still on his Instagram page. 'We got Leah's MIBG Scans back tonight and the doctors told us they didn't see any active disease in her body!!!' Scroll down for video . Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Tuesday that his daughter Leah (above) may be cancer free . Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease . Still shared the news of his Twitter and Instagram . He went on to say; 'We still have to wait for her MRI and bone biopsy results later this week. But the doctors feel very optimistic about them because of the results from today. So for now we celebrate!!' Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy. She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research. In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment. Leah and her dad have also written a book that aims to help children who are battling the disease . The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance . Leah's MBIG scans showed no active disease in her body, though the family is still waiting on an MRI and bone biopsy results . Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys. The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play. The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage.",

        "input_text": "Sigma Alpha Epsilon, the fraternity at the center of the racist University of Oklahoma video, has its roots in the pre-Civil War Deep South. 'We came up from Dixie land,' says a ditty from an old songbook, boasting about SAE's success. Now, nearly 160 years after its founding at the University of Alabama, another song - this one chanted by members of the frat's University of Oklahoma chapter and containing racial slurs and lynching references - hearkens back to the bad old times in the land of cotton and puts a new spotlight on the group's activities over the years. SAE officials insist the chant is neither a sanctioned song nor is it taught to fraternity members. This is believed to be a portrait of the original founding members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity in 1856 at the University of Alabama . Chappell Cook (bottom row, second from right) objected to the fraternity expanding North because he believed 'agitation' over slavery would make it impossible for 'harmony' Though the fraternity has its own fraught racial history. Members originally planned to keep the fraternity on in the South. When the question of 'Northern Expansion' was brought up, one charter member - later a Confederate army surgeon - said he didn't think heading north was wise because 'the constant agitation of the slavery question' would make getting along impossible. It is claimed that the fraternity did not invite a black member until 1966 - and it took one activist brother seven ballots and a threat to ban every other new pledge before the other brothers assented. In more recent years, fraternity chapters across the country have gotten into trouble over racial incidents - including a hip hop-themed 'Cripmas party' at Clemson University and an entire chapter being suspended at Washington University at St. Louis in 2013 over allegations of racial insensitivity. If there are any other chapters that use the song, 'we need to address that with those chapters and stop it immediately to stamp out this type of behavior,' said Sigma Alpha Epsilon spokesman Brandon Weghorst. The lyrics 'are so hateful and spiteful that it's embarrassing to think that Sigma Alpha Epsilon members would even know the chant or how it goes, if they've heard it.' The fraternity was also investigating reports of other SAE incidents that may have been tainted with racism, Weghorst said. Outed: Levi Pettit was identified by his family on Tuesday night. They apologized for his 'disgusting' behavior. Right, Pettit - an accomplished golfer at his former school Highland Park - is pictured putting in a 2013 photo . Parker Rice, a University of Oklahoma freshman from Dallas, has been identified as the conductor leading the 'there will never be a n***** in SEA' chant on Saturday . SAE began on the Tuscaloosa campus on March 9, 1856, a few months after Noble Leslie DeVotie outlined his vision to a close circle of friends during a stroll along the banks of the Black Warrior River. The initial members visualized 'a bond which would hold them together for all time,' William C. Levere wrote in a 1916 history of the fraternity. 'So it came about that in the late hours of a stormy night, the friends met in the old southern mansion and by the flicker of dripping candles organized Sigma Alpha Epsilon.' More chapters were soon launched in Tennessee, North Carolina and even Washington, D.C., at what is now George Washington University. But the founders weren't interested in a national presence. According to Levere, it was their intention 'to confine the fraternity to the southern states.' When a North Carolina chapter member raised the topic of a 'Northern Extension,' charter member Thomas Chappell Cook - who later served as a surgeon in the Confederate army - responded that 'the constant agitation of the slavery question was a barrier to northern chapters, as it would preclude the possibility of harmony.' The Civil War soon put an end to the internal debate. The fraternity's charter was surrendered in 1861 because of the fighting. The Washington City Rho chapter was the only one to emerge from the war intact. SAE would not return to its birthplace until 1886, after the Reconstruction-era ban on 'secret societies' was relaxed and the school's trustees, in the words of Levere, repealed 'its obnoxious anti-fraternity laws.' In the meantime, the fraternity had granted its first Northern charter in 1883 to, of all schools, Pennsylvania College — the abolitionist institution now known as Gettysburg College. The editors of the New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture call SAE 'the first Greek-letter society founded in Dixie to take permanent root ...' Even in those early years, the fraternity sought to prove that it's more than just a provincial organization. The international headquarters of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is seen in Evanston, Illinois. The organization re-located to Illinois after being founded in pre-Civil War Alabama . SAE was proud to claim President William McKinley as a member at Ohio's Mount Union College — even though it was an honorary initiation that came long after McKinley's college days. In December 1930, the fraternity dedicated its international headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Evanston. But, like other fraternities North and South, SAE had not yet embraced racial diversity. In his 2013 book, 'The People's Advocate,' attorney Daniel P. Sheehan claims credit for championing the bid of Tommy Williamson, who he wrote was 'the first black man to ever receive a nomination for membership in SAE in the entire history of that old, traditional southern fraternity.' According to Sheehan, he was social chairman of SAE's Harvard chapter in 1966. He and Williamson, a defensive lineman on the Crimson football team, both lived at Kirkland House, and Williamson's was the first name he called when it was time to vote for new members. On the first ballot, Sheehan said, Williamson received three 'blackballs,' or negative votes. Sheehan then announced he would blackball every other nominee until whoever had blocked Williamson 'fessed up and gave us their reasons,' he wrote. It took six more ballots for a member to admit that he was voting against Williamson because he'd heard that the Piedmont, California, native 'dated white women.' Sheehan said Williamson's nomination was approved on the seventh ballot. But when Sheehan told him how the vote had gone down, he wrote, Williamson declined the invitation. Reached by telephone Tuesday, Williamson, who practices employment law in Washington, D.C., told The Associated Press that he wasn't really all that interested in joining a fraternity, especially if some members didn't want him. This is the University of Alabama SAE house. The fraternity was founded on this campus - though forced to shut down after the Civil War . 'I didn't want to be the sort of obsessive token negro that, wherever you could be the first black person to do something, you would do that just because you thought white people thought that would help move their organization ahead,' he said. In a phone interview Tuesday, Sheehan, who practices constitutional law and teaches at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said of the Oklahoma video: 'That's pretty stunning, actually. I'm glad they shut that chapter down.' Brandon Weghorst, an SAE spokesman, was unable to say whether Williamson was indeed the first black man formally invited to join a chapter. 'Only within the last couple of years has the organization started to track the ethnicity of people who join the organization,' he said. SAE has had its share of controversy in more recent years. In 1988, the founding chapter was suspended again — this time for violations of the university's drug codes. The suspension was lifted two years later, only to be levied again in 1992 when the chapter failed to meet the goals outlined for reinstatement. Most of the actions taken against SAE in the past have been for infractions of a non-racial nature. But the University of Oklahoma video is not an isolated incident. Last year, SAE reached what it called 'a historic milestone' — becoming the first large national fraternity to eliminate the pledge process. 'Instead, we have implemented a holistic education known as the True Gentleman Experience,' SAE says on its website. 'It provides education throughout a member's collegiate tenure and fosters both personal and professional development.' On its website, Sigma Alpha Epsilon says its mission, based on ideals set forth by the founders, is 'to promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship, and service ...' The fraternity's creed, 'The True Gentleman,' specifies conduct that 'proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety.' On Monday, the national organization suspended the Oklahoma chapter for failing to live up to that creed.",

        "input_text": "It would be lovely to think that Nick Cruwys will wake up soon to be told of the compassion and humility shown by a growing army of football supporters. At the time of writing he is in a coma, fighting for his life after being ambushed by a group of Wolverhampton Wanderers fans as he made his way to the railway station after Watford's 2-2 draw at Molineux on Saturday. A group of Wolves supporters were so ashamed of the incident that they set up a website, a page dedicated to raising money to pay for Cruwys's travel and tickets to future matches. Watford fan Nick Cruwys (left) is currently in a coma after being ambushed by a group of Wolves fans as he made his way to the station following the 2-2 draw in the Championship fixture (right) at Molineux on Saturday . Over £22,000 has been raised for Nick Cruwys via a football fund set up by group of  Wolves supporters . Watford fan Nick Cruwys lies on the ground as he is attacked following his side's draw with Wolves . Cruwys is currently in an induced coma and fighting for his life in hospital . Cruwys was heading to Wolverhampton train station when he was subjected to an 'unprovoked attack' The initial target was £1,000 but by Tuesday evening 1,672 people had raised £22,089. Football can respond in the most remarkable ways, but these supporters know that society's fragile truce with the game ended when this vicious and unprovoked attack took place. We have a tendency to move on so quickly, to switch on the television set, to sit down to watch Liverpool against Blackburn and then look forward to a mouth-watering FA Cup tie between Manchester United and Arsenal. It is natural. Always looking forward, leaving the bad bits of the weekend behind and hoping for a better result for our team on Saturday. Nothing wrong with that, nothing at all. But sometimes we must pause for thought, to return to the scene of the crime for a few salutary moments and think about this poor guy in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. To wonder what it must be like for a family member to receive a call from the police telling them that their husband, their dad, their son, is lying in a hospital, in a coma, may never wake up. Cruwys was making his way to the train station after the 2-2 draw between the sides at Molineux (pictured) Troy Deeney (left) stretches out top convert the equaliser  for Watford who took a point in a 2-2 draw . Deeney celebrates after his goal prevented rivals Wolves from taking all three points in the promotion race . Or to consider his friends, the people who witnessed this horrific attack as they made their way through that intimidating underpass near the stadium and headed for the railway station. Or the innocent bystanders, the people who are frozen in time when these injudicious attacks take place. They, too, will be traumatised. Then there are the perpetrators, the thugs who are responsible for this attack. Are they proud men today, or hiding like cowards? Cruwys is a football fan like me or you, following his team - Watford, in this case - around the country on a Saturday afternoon. There is a rising tide in the sport, the 'Who-Wants-Some?' culture creating waves again after more raw footage emerged from Villa Park last weekend. What is the motivation for this? Please don't say a 5.30pm kick-off meaning lads full of ale, because that is no excuse either. We cannot put a news value on someone's existence either, just because the team Cruwys follows do not play to the bells and whistles of the Barclays Premier League each weekend. This is someone's life and we have a moral obligation to address these perplexing issues. Aston Villa fans storm on to the Villa Park pitch after their 2-0 win against West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup . The 5.30pm kick-off in the West Midlands derby on Saturday was no excuse for the behaviour of the fans . West Midlands Police are making some progress in the hunt for the thugs who did this and an appeal for witnesses was retweeted 82 times over the past few days. There is a desire to do more, to create an environment where tribal passion is not overwhelmed by people, however small their number, throwing punches, even in isolated incidents. For Cruwys and his friends, who were among the 2,239 Watford supporters who made the trip to Wolves, the game was a real nail-biter. Leaving the ground they would have been pleased to get a point. The Watford great Kenny Jackett, a long-serving player and former manager at Vicarage Road, is now manager of Wolves. He remains a popular figure with their fans. Towards the end of a riveting 2-2 draw, Wolves defender Bakary Sako was sent off when Watford substitute Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face. That incident is not to be interpreted as a causal link because nothing that happened on a football pitch can ever justify what happened next. Wolves boss Kenny Jackett is a former Watford player and manager and remains a popular figure with fans . Bakary Sako was sent off after Fernando Forestieri went down clutching his face following an altercation . To think Cruwys's day ended with his family being informed that he is in a coma takes us into unforgiving territory. This is the unacceptable face of the game, a severe reminder that the sport must meet the needs of the supporters inside and outside stadiums. According to Home Office statistics there were only 2,273 football-related arrests last year, which includes all four divisions, plus European competitions and internationals. It is the lowest since records began. Last season 33 million people attended matches and less than 0.01 per cent of those in attendance were arrested. The numbers look good on paper, but the Home Office also makes it clear that the police do not always have the manpower to make arrests. If 5,000 fans stormed the pitch at Villa Park - theoretically every one of them should be arrested and banned . Fans charge towards Scott Sinclair and his team-mates after his goal against West Brom on Saturday . For example, let's say around 5,000 Villa supporters invaded the pitch at the end of their 2-0 victory over West Brom in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday. Theoretically, every one of them could be arrested and banned from Villa Park for life. It will never happen, which is why those Home Office statistics can easily be distorted. There is certainly some grim reading in the West Midlands at the moment, with the police force making further appeals on Monday to jog the memory of anyone who witnessed the incident in Wolverhampton. Wrong place, wrong time? Don't give me that. The police force made further appeals for witnesses on Monday (pictured - a post on Cruwys' funding page)",

        "input_text": "You don't  restrict an artist. He's there to create, to entertain, to slap his imagination on a blank canvas and leave the world wondering  how the hell he did it. Louis van Gaal used Juan Mata as a 'false right winger' at Anfield six days ago, and threw off the shackles that were once strapped to his ankles by David Moyes and Jose Mourinho. The  two-time Chelsea Player of the Year showed good things come to those who wait, as Liverpool's 3-4-3 formation that snookered teams from January onward was lost on Manchester United. Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata scores the second of his double to seal an important win at Anfield . Mata's perfect technique for his scissor-kick was brilliant as he scored one of the goals of the season . Liverpool could do little to stop Mata's incredible scissor-kick giving them a 2-0 lead at Anfield . Mata runs away in celebration with United team-mates Marouane Fellaini (right) and Wayne Rooney (left) It was, if nothing else, unexpected. Mata had gone unused, having played just 15 minutes across four Premier League games in February, and it was reminiscent of his bit-part role at Chelsea. Mourinho considered Oscar a better fit as his No 10, believing Mata's defensive cover left a lot to be desired. He is not a tackler, nor is he the physical type. You don't buy a Jack Russell Terrier then expect it to behave like an American Pit Bull. Mata is a different breed. What he is, is an architect. Since the start of the 2011-12 Barclays Premier League season, he has more goals and assists in total (65) than any other midfielder. Close behind is Manchester City's David Silva (63) and Yaya Toure (61), then Chelsea's Eden Hazard and Liverpool's Steven Gerrard (both 58). Yet his defensive discipline – or lack thereof – is what Mourinho considered his Achilles heel. It's true the midfielder averages the fewest tackles (0.64), clearances (0.16) and duels won (14.29 per cent) per game when he, Silva, Toure, Hazard and Gerrard are compared, but that's not his job. Mata left Chelsea for United in a £37m switch but manager David Moyes never got his money's worth . Mata's prayers have been answered at United as he looks to get a regular run out by Louis van Gaal . Only Silva (365) beats him in chances created out of the entire Premier League since the beginning of 2011-12, but Mata (291) has played 466 fewer minutes. He's the creative kind, but would most likely still be warming the substitutes' bench at Stamford Bridge had he not swapped south for north. It was Moyes that bought Mata from Chelsea, phoning him personally to explain what he wanted. Fluidity, assists and goals were the demands, and Mata agreed. Two days later, he arrived at Carrington – by helicopter, no less – and it was confirmed. Chelsea made a tidy £13.5m from the Mata move. Shrewd as ever, as they were with David Luiz (£31.6m profit), Andre Schurrle (£4m), Kevin De Bruyne (£11m), Romelu Lukaku (£18m) and Thorgan Hazard (£5.5m), among others. Moyes, however, never got his money's worth. Mata celebrates his goal with team-mate Daley Blind at Anfield on Sunday during their win . Mata has more goals and assists in total (65) than any other midfielder in the Premier League since 2011 . It was when he left Manchester with the club in seventh that the inquest began. He hadn't kept Sir Alex Ferguson's backroom staff. He failed to replace Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra. His style of football was cautious, slow and predictable compared to his predecessor's attacking outlook. Another supposed error was wasting £64m on Marouane Fellaini and Mata. Yet the new man at Manchester United is getting what Moyes couldn't out of both. Against Liverpool, Fellaini and Mata covered the most distance (11.6km each) out of everyone. Mata had more touches (93) than anyone else, made 73 passes with 91.8 per cent accuracy, and made Hazard proud by drawing more fouls than any other player (3). For a player without a shot on target in the Premier League since December 20, he scored two goals worthy of settling the great rivalry. Alberto Moreno, lugging five yards behind for Mata's first and not tracking him for the second, was tormented by the man that goes by 'Johnny Kills' – a suitable nickname handed to him by former Chelsea team-mate Daniel Sturridge because it is a literal translation of his name. Juan Mata's heat map from Manchester United's 2-1 win at Liverpool last weekend . Alberto Moreno was tormented by Mata at Anfield but the challenge is for him to make it consistent . Mata runs with the ball during the tense match between the two great rivals of the Premier League . United's average positions vs Liverpool (left) with Mata (No 8) drifting inside... and his total passes (right) Mata's heat map vs Tottenham Hotspur on March 15 in United's 3-0 win at Old Trafford saw him drift inside . Jan 1 vs Stoke - 90 minutes . Jan 11 vs Southampton - 90 . Jan 17 vs QPR - 45 . Jan 31 vs Leicester - 13 . Feb 8 vs West Ham - 0 . Feb 11 vs Burnley - 0 . Feb 21 vs Swansea - 11 . Feb 28 vs Sunderland - 4 . March 4 vs Newcastle - 8 . March 15 vs Tottenham - 77 . March 22 vs Liverpool - 90 . Against Liverpool, right-back Antonio Valencia was used as cover, sprinting up the wing to allow Mata to abandon his post. Those two exchanged more passes (55) than anyone else on Sunday, and worked in tandem. Their average positions show Mata (No 8) stayed close to Ander Herrera (No 21), who was equally devastating at Anfield, while Valencia (No 25) pushed up, just short of the half-way line. Mata played a similar role against Tottenham Hotspur the week before,  as his almost identical heat maps above demonstrate. But he is not out of the woods yet. Mata is flirting with a first-team place, having replaced an out-of-sorts Angel di Maria, but the trick is to stay there. He has been crying out for this, ever since he was phased out at Chelsea, and even more so now he has been dropped by Spain. Mata has played 3,724 minutes and made 44 starts in the past two seasons. Restricted, to say the least, when compared to former Chelsea team-mate Hazard, who has  5,461 minutes and  61 starts. It's easier said than done to become a must-pick – £37m doesn't buy you that luxury these days. Can it happen at Manchester United?

        "input_text": "What is the last thing you remember about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo? For Messi, it is most likely him tearing Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City apart, making them look like a League One team lost in Europe, nutmegging James Milner to leave him with grass stains on his backside. For Ronaldo, it may be him throwing his arm in the air in disdain, sulking back to the halfway line, protesting even though team-mate Gareth Bale had just put Real Madrid 1-0 up against Levante. Lionel Messi may well be priceless as the Barcelona star continues to find the best form of his career . Messi smiles during Barcelona's win over Manchester City that knocked them out of the Champions League . Cristiano Ronaldo cannot mask his frustration during Real Madrid's last match against Levante . It was a tough night for Ronaldo, who will need to improve fast for El Clasico against Messi's Barcelona . It is an unforgiving game for the two undisputed best players on the planet. Yet there is currently no debate to be had. Not even close. The headlines this week belong to Messi, even if he didn't break a Champions League record on Wednesday and his free-kicks served only to remind us he is human after all. There was more to his embarrassment of Manchester City than missing out on his ninth goal in the tournament. Much more. If it wasn't his menacing dribbles, it was his six shots against a magnificent Joe Hart. If it wasn't his assist for Ivan Rakitic's goal, it was his nutmeg on Milner that reduced Pep Guardiola – the architect of the Barcelona way and current Bayern Munich manager – to nothing more than another supporter in the stands. The one-twos, the drops of the shoulder, the shimmies. Pep has seen it all before – at the Nou Camp, at their Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper training ground, at almost every stadium he took Barcelona to – yet still it was enough for him to hide his face in disbelief. He wasn't alone. Barcelona's Messi taunts the City defence on the edge of the penalty area during another classy performance . Messi joins in the celebrations after Ivan Rakitic's opening goal with Luis Suarez (right) at the Nou Camp . Messi's heat map showed he was very active in the City half. Click here for more from our Match Zone service . Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo hailed the 'Fantastic' Messi after his 'masterclass' against Manchester City that included 'nutmegs, dribbles and an assist', while he also featured on the front cover of Sport . Should we have expected anything less? Messi has been untouchable this year. So much so it's almost unfair, and part of the credit can even go to – dare we say it? – his nemesis, Ronaldo. It was on January 12 when the Real Madrid man got the better of the Barca boy for the 2014 Ballon d'Or award, three weeks after Ronaldo returned to his hometown of Funchal on the island of Madeira to unveil a statue of himself. Before the Ballon d'Or ceremony, Ronaldo beat Messi in goals (33 to 25), goals per game (1.18 to 1), minutes per goal (70.94 to 87.24), shots (119 to 96), minutes-per-goal involvement (52.02 to 58.95) and they had 12 assists apiece in all competitions. Messi sat there in Zurich, to the left of Ronaldo, and gritted his teeth afterwards as he congratulated the man that won with 37.66 per cent of the vote for his third Ballon d'Or. Deservedly so, too. Yet Ronaldo's cry of 'Si' lit something under the four-time winner. Hell hath no fury like a Messi scorned, and he is arguably playing better than when he was crowned the world's best in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Since the Ballon d'Or ceremony, there's been no contest. Messi beats Ronaldo on goals (18 to 8), goals per game (1.2 to 0.73), minutes per goal (75 to 122.75), shots (60 to 52), chances created (39 to 17), assists (9 to 3) and minutes-per-goal involvement (50 to 89.27). Messi has been outstanding ever since Ronaldo won the Ballon d'Or on January 12 and the stats prove it . The frustration against Levante was written all over Ronaldo's face as he leaned against the frame of the goal . How the top of La Liga stands ahead of El Clasico . It's unrecognisable. A complete reversal. To the overall statistics in all competitions this season, it puts Messi ahead in the three major categories: goals (43 to 41), assists (21 to 15) and, comfortably, chances created (112 to 68). Down to the brass tacks of La Liga, too. There was a moment on November 22, when Ronaldo had 20 goals to Messi's seven. Yet today, Ronaldo has 30 to Messi's 32. All this has reopened the debate between Messi and his great rival that had a dissimilar experience in Europe last Tuesday. Ronaldo is congratulated by FIFA president Sepp Blatter during the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich . Ronaldo cry of 'Si' lit something under four-time winner Messi, who has obliterated his form ever since . Ronaldo must up his game to stay in competition with Messi if he is to retain the Ballon d'Or next year . Ronaldo, for a man that had broken the Champions League goalscoring record, left the pitch shaking his head following a 4-3 defeat by Schalke at the Bernabeu. Those all-too-familiar white handkerchiefs were waved in his team's direction, and the Spanish whistles were piercing. 'I won't talk again until the end of the season,' Ronaldo announced afterwards, as frustrated as any, while a poll by Spanish newspaper AS found 32.2 per cent voted for Cristiano to be dropped. All is not right in Ronaldo's world, and he has been putting in additional work this week at the Ciudad Real Madrid training ground in Valdebebas. Messi, meanwhile, warmed up for El Clasico by putting on a masterclass for Manchester City at the Nou Camp. Ronaldo has been putting in extra work this week at the Ciudad Real Madrid training ground in Valdebebas . Ronaldo has been at the training ground preparing hard for the trip to Barcelona's Nou Camp on Sunday . Guardiola wasn't the only one mesmerised. Just look at the feedback: . The kid from next door in Barcelona, with the ability to glue the ball to his foot, has been swaying a few votes in his favour, it seems. Yet on Sunday at 8pm, another chapter of Messi vs Ronaldo – a rivalry that demands its own Wikipedia page – will be written in front of an estimated global television audience of 500 million. Messi received plenty of  feedback from the world of football and beyond for his performance against City . Messi delivered a man of the match performance as he ran the City defence ragged at the Nou Camp . The table below shows how the attacking trios of Barcelona (Messi, Neymar and Suarez) and Real Madrid (Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale) compare in all competitions. Green indicates the player that comes out on top in that category, such as Messi for goals, while those in red shows them as the worst of the six, such as Neymar for assists.",

Suarez scored the first and last goals in the 6-1 win. 'He is giving us more and more with every week that passes’ said Luis Enrique.

Bookings: Tito, Trashorras, Aquino . Sent off: Tito . Rayo Vallecano are more used to lunchtime kick-offs than Barcelona but Suarez had no problems with the early start as he put the home side ahead after just six minutes. He received the ball from Xavi having sprung Rayo’s adventurous offside trap and, with the outside of his right boot, spun a shot past the advancing Cristian Alvarez. It was one of his best goals since joining the club, and it was also his ninth since the turn of the year. Barcelona should then have wrapped up the three points in the next 20 minutes but were wasteful in front of goal and unfortunate with a penalty decision that went against them. First Suarez was sent racing away once again as Rayo persisted with a suicidal high defensive line but his cross to Pedro was cut out by a recovering defender. The former Liverpool striker then went through on Alvarez but was bundled down from behind by Abdoulaye Ba only for the referee to wave play on. Pedro was next to go close went put through by Messi but his effort was saved by Alvarez who was helping to keep Rayo in the game. He was also spending a lot of time sweeping up outside his area. The visiting manager Paco Jemez had said before the game that losing by seven would be the same as losing by a single goal and his attacking tactics were keeping him to his word. Rayo had their chances too. Trashorras in particular tested Claudio Bravo from open play and from a free-kick after Javier Mascherano had fouled on the edge of the area and been booked for his trouble. Barcelona could not extend their lead before the break but they came close just before the half time whistle with what would have been one of the goals of the season. Suarez lofted a pass over the top of Rayo’s defensive line to Messi and flicked it first time over the goalkeeper but just wide of the target. If Jemez spent the break convincing his players they get back into the game the belief was undone within five minutes of the restart. Xavi took a corner, Jordi Alba headed it on to a post and when it came back down in the six-yard box Pique forced it over the line.

Barcelona moved top of La Liga with a 6-1 win over Real Madrid at the Nou Camp on Sunday lunchtime . Rayo were 3-0 down, and a man down, before the hour mark. Full-back Tito had been booked in the first half and when he grappled Suarez to ground inside the area the referee pointed to the spot and pulled out a second yellow and then the red. It was Messi’s first spot-kick since having his penalty saved by Joe Hart at the Etihad. He seemed to wait an age before steering it to the keeper’s right and seeing it comfortably saved. There was a let-off to come however with the referee deciding it needed to be taken again. At the second attempt he put it to the keeper’s left and this time the ball  nestled in the corner. The roof was coming down on Rayo now and Messi soon made it 4-0 turning in a Suarez pass. Alvarez then saved the Barcelona number ten’s free-kick to deny him a hat-trick. He wasn’t denied for long however. On minute 63 substitute Rafinha sent the ball out to Alba and he crossed for Messi to quick-step around the last defender and convert for his third goal of the game, his 30th of the season and his 24th La Liga hat-trick –no one has ever scored more. Alves was sent off for bringing down Alberto Bueno. He looked to get the ball before the player but the referee pointed to the spot and the former Real Madrid youngster scored the penalty. There was still time for Suarez to get his second of the game. He raced clear of Rayo’s still stubbornly high line but played in Messi instead of finishing himself and watched as the pass just run away from his team-mate. Messi repaid the favour when he slipped Suarez through and with seconds of normal time remaining he made it six.

        "input_text": "It was on December 21 – the day Liverpool began their unbeaten run – that a bloke dressed as Jesus Christ held a sign at Anfield that read: 'Brendan, I've got your back!' Yet divine intervention has nothing to do with it. It is Brendan Rodgers that has resurrected Liverpool by throwing out the old system and implementing the new. Tactics in football can be as precarious as a game of rock, paper, scissors. Nothing is guaranteed, and there is always a risk, but Liverpool have found a way to expose others and not themselves. A man dressed as Jesus Christ was spotted at Anfield during Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Arsenal in December . Liverpool's unbeaten run in the Premier League began on December 21 at Anfield in a 2-2 draw with Arsenal . Liverpool's bandaged-up defender Martin Skrtel (right) celebrates scoring against Arsenal as the run began . The turning point was at Old Trafford on December 14 when Rodgers finally released his grasp on 4-2-3-1. They lost 3-0 in their 3-4-3 experiment, but that by no means tells the story. Just 25 seconds separated the excellent David de Gea's save from Raheem Sterling at one end, and Wayne Rooney's opening goal for Manchester United at the other. Mike Mullarkey, the linesman, failed to recognise Juan Mata was more than a yard offside when he made it two. A defensive error by Dejan Lovren created the third. Liverpool were torn apart by preventable goals. The visitors got into scoring positions more frequently, having 19 shots to Manchester United's 11, but lacked a cutting edge. At least they weren't as cramped as they were against Basle the week before (shown below, left), where right-back Glen Johnson (No 2) drifted inside and Sterling (No 31) led the 4-2-3-1 formation. Dec 06 - Liverpool 0-0 Sunderland - 4-2-3-1 . Dec 09 - Liverpool 1-1 Basle - 4-2-3-1 . Dec 14 - Manchester United 3-0 Liverpool  - 3-4-3 . Dec 17 - Bournemouth 1-3 Liverpool - 3-4-3 . Dec 21 - Liverpool 2-2 Arsenal - 3-4-3 . Dec 26 - Burnley 0-1 Liverpool - 3-4-3 . Liverpool played 4-2-3-1 against Basle on Dec 9 (left) with right-back Glen Johnson (No 2) drifting inside and Raheem Sterling (No 31) up front... but they switched to 3-4-3 against Manchester United on Dec 14 (right) Sterling sees his shot saved by Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea at Old Trafford on December 14 . It took just 25 seconds for United to go up the other end for Wayne Rooney to score the opener (pictured) United's Juan Mata was offside by more than a yard but the goal counted as the linesman failed to notice . Mata runs away in celebration while Brad Jones, having replaced Simon Mignolet, looks towards the linesman . Liverpool's average positions in their latest win against Burnley shows they still play 3-4-3 . Even though Liverpool were hit for three by Manchester United, they persisted with 3-4-3 in the next game against Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup quarter-final, and have done since. It's helped them get 29 points since Christmas, while Merseyside rivals Everton have just 28 in total for the season. Just look at their 2-0 win against Burnley on Wednesday, for example (shown right). Emre Can (No 23) dropped into the back three. Alberto Moreno (No 18), a left-back with a winger's soul, was pushed forward. Joe Allen (No 24) and Jordan Henderson (No 14) owned central midfield in tandem, and the three-pronged attack featuring Sterling (No 31), Daniel Sturridge (No 15) and the indispensable Philippe Coutinho (No 10) worked. They're fast, they swarm, they press, they move. It's not rocket science, yet it leaves teams bewildered. Fit-again Sturridge started on Wednesday rather than Sterling being used in the middle, as he had been against Manchester City and Southampton. Easing Sturridge back in, as is only natural after an injury that cost five months. Possession too, it seems, is no longer nine-tenths of the law. Manchester City had 51 per cent against Liverpool at Anfield, yet lost 2-1. Southampton had 60 per cent, and lost 2-0. As was the case with Tottenham Hotspur, Swansea City, and so on. Steven Gerrard pictured doing keepie uppies during Liverpool's training session at Melwood on Friday . Gerrard runs with the ball as he looks to help his team continue their fine form following his injury . Liverpool have claimed 29 points since Christmas, while rivals Everton have 28 in total for the season . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers made the switch from 4-2-3-1 to 3-4-3 on December 14 and it's worked . 'We have restructured the team and organised the team in a different way,' Rodgers said last month, 'to get that solidity back and get the balance back both offensively and defensively.' It sounded like one of those generic responses that roll off managers' tongues, but there was more to this. Even at the back. Simon Mignolet was dropped for goalkeeper Brad Jones against Manchester United, but returned to the first team on Boxing Day. Since then, Liverpool have conceded the least (6) in the Premier League and have the best goal difference (+15). No surprise, then, that a table since December 26 puts them top (29 points) ahead of Arsenal (27) and, remarkably, Stoke City (23). Mignolet makes a save during Liverpool's comfortable 2-0 win over Burnley at Anfield on Wednesday night . Mignolet was dropped for Jones against United in December, but returned to the first team on Boxing Day . Yet should we expect anything less? Rodgers has a knack for upping the ante, after all. In 2012-13, Liverpool averaged 1.47 points per game between August and December, rising to 2.5 between January and May. In 2013-14, they went from 1.89 to 2.53. And this year, they have gone from 1.47 to 2.56. Only Wolfsburg (2.67) better that out of every club in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1, yet Liverpool have played three more games. And if they maintain their 2.56 average, Liverpool would end up with 77 points – enough for them to qualify for the Champions League in nine out of the past 10 years. Daniel Sturridge  scores against Burnley at Anfield on Wednesday night as he gets back to full fitness . The return of Sturridge following a combination of thigh and calf problems helps but he has been eased in . Sturridge started against Burnley but began on the bench against Manchester City and Southampton . The return of Sturridge following a combination of thigh and calf problems helps. Without him, they average 1.3 goals per game, 1.5 points and their win percentage is a measly 42.1. With him, it rises to 1.9 goals, 2.4 points and 77.8 per cent. Who needs Luis Suarez? Or Steven Gerrard, for that matter. Jordan Henderson has captained Liverpool eight times in the Premier League since November 29, winning seven and drawing one. They have scored 15 goals and conceded just twice when the hard-working deputy wears the armband. No other captain in the Premier League has a better win percentage than him (88). A natural, it would seem. Even Lucas Leiva, when not injured, provides cover for the back three as a defensive midfielder. Rodgers has a man for every occasion, and it's clicking at the right time. Gerrard led Liverpool to Champions League glory against AC Milan in 2005 but is leaving for the MLS soon . Jordan Henderson has been in inspired form for Liverpool and struck sensational goals in his last two games . Henderson has led the team in Gerrard's absence as Liverpool have made a charge for the top four . If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Their luck with 3-4-3 – arguably 3-4-2-1 on occasion – may well run out, because imperfections will always be there. The price of failing to qualify for the Champions League? Some £31.3million, give or take – not including the prize money – and the unwanted consolation of Europa League football. Trouble is, their new system is no secret. Others will try to copy or stump them, and Rodgers must anticipate it. In 210 minutes against Chelsea in two Capital One Cup semi-final legs, after all, Liverpool scored just once and were eliminated. It's so far, so good. All this will matter little if they don't beat Manchester United on March 22, or Arsenal on April 4, or do better against Chelsea on May 9. Ripping up the blueprint in mid-December was a start. Time for the finish.",

The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load, according to an Inside Defense report. Though it's mandated that an F-35B jet, designed by Lockheed Martin, hold eight SDB IIs in the bay, only four reportedly fit. The F-35 program will reportedly cost a whopping $590 billion over the next decade. Trouble in the skies: The F-35B's internal weapons bay is too small for a Small Diameter Bomb II (SDB II) load (file photo) The F-35B is one of three variants of the F-35 program, which has proved expensive and troublesome to get off the ground. The F-35B features a lift fan that will allow it to make short takeoffs and vertical landings, Inside Defense reported. In the US, it will be used by the Marine Corps. However, the F-35B is the centerpiece of the British Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier-based fleet. The Ministry of Defense has ordered 48 of the aircraft and they are the only fighter jets set to launch off two planned British aircraft carriers - the HMS Queen Elizabeth and the HMS Prince of Wales. The F-35 program has been plagued by massive cost overruns and delays. Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 program, said in an Inside Defense interview last week that changes are being made to the F-35B jet so it can be released on schedule. DellaVedova also said that Lockheed Martin will likely get the alterations contract down the line in 2015. 'This is not a new issue to us,' DellaVedova told Inside Defense. 'We've been working with the SDB II program office and their contractors since 2007. 'The fit issues have been known and documented and there were larger and more substantial modifications needed to support SDB II that have already been incorporated into production F-35 aircraft. 'These minor or remaining changes were put on hold until the aircraft reached a sufficient level of maturity to ensure that the needed changes would not adversely impact any ongoing SDB [II] developments.' Inside Defense reported that the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program office so far has not publicly recognized problems - and that eight internal and 16 external SDB IIs are in fact meant to go on the F-35B. Bombs away: The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, defense contractor Raytheon says . Defense contractor Raytheon is behind the SDB II bomb. The company proclaims on its website 'SDB II can fly more than 45 miles to strike mobile targets, reducing aircrews' time in harm's way. The weapon's small size allows fewer aircraft to take out the same number of targets as previous, larger weapons that required multiple jets. SDB II's size has broader implications for the warfighter and taxpayers, as it means fewer attacks with less time spent flying dangerous missions.' The SDB II can employ a number of techniques - including imaging infrared, laser, and radar homing - to hit targets, the company says. The SDB II weapons system is fully accommodated by both the F-35A - the Air Force version - and F-35C - the US Navy version, company executive Jeff White told Inside Defense. White told the news outlet 'I think it's just the B. When we did our fit checks on the JSF, the A and the C basically had the same bay.' 353 F-35Bs are being bought by the United States Marines Corps, Inside Defense reported. According to the news outlet, approximately 17,000 weapons will come from the United States Air Force's SDB II program.",

Chris Page, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'This week will be cold with sunny spells and some wintry showers. 'These showers will see snow fall on the hills in the north of the country. 'Temperatures this week will get a little bit colder and will certainly feel cooler because of the blustery winds.' The Met Office has issued a weather warning for this evening, with heavy rain expected to fall and turn into wintry showers and ice by the morning. Snowy conditions are forecast in the north of the UK on Monday and Tuesday, giving way to showers by Wednesday as cold weather continues . On alert: Met Office yellow 'be aware' severe weather warnings for ice and snow tonight (left) and tomorrow (right) in western Britain . A graphic produced by Magic Seaweed shows strong winds moving towards the UK on Tuesday which will make it feel a lot colder . Two lambs were born in Shugborough Hall this week and are pictured with Melissa Underwood-Grattage - a sign of the start of Spring. But the cold temperatures are not over yet - with snow and sleet forecast for this week and the cold weather expected to last throughout March . Sunseekers' delight: By Easter Sunday on April 5 the mercury is expected to reach 21C. Pictured is Brighton beach in East Sussex in April 2014 . Cold westerly winds from Canada will bring sleet, snow and hail overnight this evening. The mercury is expected to hover at around 5C to 7C this week - considerably colder than the highs of 10C and sunny conditions seen this weekend that saw snow melt on the Derwent Dam in the Peak District. Mr Page added: 'The cold air is pushing in from the North, and temperatures are likely to drop down to zero overnight for the next few days and there is some potential for icy patches.' The cold weather this week comes as Spring officially began today. Two lambs were born this week at at Shugborough Hall estate near Stafford, the first of around 100 lambs and goat kids that are expected to be born throughout Spring. Crocuses have also sprung up in the eight-acre field of the village of Inkpen in Berkshire - another sign of the changing of the seasons this week. But the newborn lambs are unlikely to see this season getting warmer yet as cold conditions continue throughout March, which is forecast to be drier in the second half of the month but with colder nights and frost. However, by Easter Sunday on April 5 the mercury is expected to reach 21C - around 8C above average for the time of year. This is likely to be caused by a build-up of higher pressure that will bring warmer and more settled conditions. And May could be even warmer, with temperatures of up to 27C, according to British Weather Services. The warmer than average weather is leading to hopes that Britain could be on course for a hot dry summer.",

        "input_text": "Saturday Night Live pushed the envelope this week with a parody of a car commercial that had a young girl joining ISIS, and not the US Army, at the end. The segment was laid out the same as the recent My Bold Dad spot in which a father tearfully drops off his daughter to join the military in his Toyota Camry. The spot that first aired during the 2015 Super Bowl and was seen as a touching look at what it is like to say goodbye for those that have family members in the service. In this version however, the father, played by Taran Killam, dropped off his daughter, played by Dakota Johnson, and as he tearfully said goodbye she says to him; 'Dad, it's just ISIS.' Scroll down for video . Dakota Johnson (above) played a young girl joining ISIS in a skit on Saturday Night Live . The skit ended with the tagline; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad' There was even a vehicle with the ISIS flag in the skit . This is the first time that Johnson, the star of Fifty Shades of Grey, has hosted Saturday Night Live . From there, Johnson jumped on a truck with actors playing members of the Islamic State and with a mock flag, which actually appears to read; 'I would like a cat.' When the father then says to take care of his girl, one of the men yells; 'Death to America.' Then, as the commercial ended, a message appeared on screen; 'ISIS, We'll take it from here, Dad.' Johnson winked at her father to assure him everything was all right in the parody . Some on twitter found the parody 'depraved' Others on twitter found the bit 'hysterical' Johnson teels her father not to worry saying, 'Dad, it's just ISIS' This all comes on the same week three men were arrested in the United States with ties to the terrorist organization and three female British teenagers left to join the group. The skit was met with outrage by many on Twitter, who took the program to task for being insensitive. 'Can't be serious. Isis skit? Like going to college? When so many people are being kidnapped and killed?Depraved,' wrote Raine LaChance. 'Apparently NBC and SNL thought it was funny to have a skit showing ISIS driving to an airport to pick up an American girl. Tasteless Scum!,' said Jim Ematrudo. Others however found the skit 'hilarious.' This also comes the same week that the identity of ISIS member Jihadi John was revealed and the group destroyed a collection of priceless statues and sculptures in Iraq dating back thousands of years in Mosul. John is British citizen Mohammed Emwazi, the man who is responsible for the high-profile beheadings of Americans James Foley, Peter Kassig and Steven Sotliff as well as British citizens David Haines and Alan Henning in the name of the terrorist organization. His identity was previously unknown as he always wears a mask. Canada this week also said that they believe four missing teenagers may have traveled to be in ISIS.",

        "input_text": "The Secret Service has arrested two men in two separate White House security breaches that have occurred just hours apart, sparking lockdowns at the presidential mansion. On Sunday night, an unnamed suspect stepped over a bike rack situated outside the White House fence. The bike racks were installed last year following a high-profile fence-jumping incident that involved an Army veteran armed with a knife. Early Monday morning, another person attempted to walk through a gate while a construction crew were leaving. Scroll down for video . Breached: The White House, pictured Monday, has become the site of two new security breaches that took place just hours apart and sparked lockdowns . Sneak: A man tried to walk into a pedestrian entrance as construction workers were leaving the area . According to NBC, both men were taken into custody, and the Secret Service has given the all-clear at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. The agency has been tight-lipped about the two breaches, which are now under investigation. The suspects have not been named. The bike rack-jumping incident took place at around 11.30pm Sunday near the southwest corner of the presidential residence, reported MyFox DC. The male suspect was arrested and charged with unlawful entry. The breach led to a 30-minute lockdown at the White House. Just before 7am Monday, another man allegedly tried to walk into a pedestrian entrance as construction workers were leaving the area. A Secret Service agent stopped the intruder in his tracks and arrested him after a brief confrontation. The White House was placed on another lockdown that lasted only a few minutes following the second incident. The twin security breaches come just over a month after a small drone operated by a government employee accidentally crashed on the South Lawn of the White House. Agency under fire: An incident last September involving an armed fence jumper led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's (left) resignation. Her replacement, Joseph Clancy (right), said on This Week Sunday that his agency is working to 'regain the trust' of the public . The Secret Service has come under scrutiny following a string of distressing incidents involving White House security. In September, an army veteran with a knife hidden in his pants jumped the fence and made it as far into the East Room before he was tackled. The breach led to Secret Service director Julia Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later, a college student drove up to the White House's security screening point and refused to leave, prompting his arrest. The White House was briefly on lockdown this past August after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. In an interview on ABC's This Week Sunday, Joseph Clancy, the newly appointed director of the Secret Service, said his agency is working to 'regain the trust' of the public after the litany of security breaches, reported USA Today. ‘We have not received an unfair rap,’ Clancy said.’I think when you fail, and we have failed, we own it. Now, it's up to us to correct it.’ The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.",

        "input_text": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top U.S. officials faced off Monday in dueling speeches on the high-stakes Iran nuclear negotiations, a signature foreign policy objective of President Barack Obama. 'Imagine what Iran would do with nuclear weapons,' he warned on Tuesday, saying that the Islamic republic is already training, arming and dispatching terrorists on five continents. Asked whether President Obama watched the speech, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters: 'I don’t believe that he did.' Netanyahu says a nuclear-capable Iran would have the means to achieve its stated goal of annihilating Israel. He listed a litany of instances when Israel has acted on its own, in defiance of the U.S., to protect itself. The Obama administration is pursuing talks with Tehran that critics say could ultimately allow the kind of nuclear enrichment inside Iran that Netanyahu fears most. U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power insisted on Monday in a speech preceding Netanyahu's that it will 'never' happen. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, flanked by one of his security guards, addressed the 2015 American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference in Washington on Monday . Netanyahu insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong' The backdrop for the rift between the longtime allies was the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. On Tuesday Netanyahu will address the U.S. Congress. Despite some Democrats' boycotting, demand to see the speech is brisk. 'We’ve had 10 times the number of requests for tickets than there are seats available in the gallery,' House Speaker John Boehner said Monday in an emailed statement. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Each House member gets a single ticket to give away. 'I could scalp that ticket, there are so many people who want it,' Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg told The Washington Times. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Obama has repeatedly cautioned Israel not to launch pre-emptive attacks against Tehran, but Netanyahu suggested Monday that he could choose to act unilaterally as his country has done in the past, even at the risk of alienating the United States. Sara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attended her husband's speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference on Monday . 'In 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall opposed David Ben-Gurion's intention to declare statehood,' Netanyahu recalled. 'That's an understatement – he vehemently opposed it. But, Ben-Gurion, understanding what was at stake, went ahead and declared Israel's independence.' 'In 1967, as an Arab noose was tightening around Israel's neck, the United States warned ... that if Israel acted alone, it would be alone. But Israel did act – acted alone – to defend itself.' 'In 1981, under the leadership of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor at Osirak,' Netanyahu continued. 'The United States criticized Israel and suspended arms-transfers for three months. 'And in 2002, after the worst wave of Palestinian terror attacks in Israel's history, Prime Minister Sharon launched Operation Defensive Shield. The United States demanded that Israel withdraw its troops immediately but Sharon continued until the operation was completed.' 'I mention them to make a point,' he said. 'Despite occasional disagreements, the friendship between America and Israel grew stronger and stronger, decade after decade. And our friendship will weather the current disagreements as well to grow even stronger in the future.' US United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power told AIPAC that the United States will 'never' allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . The alliance between Israel and the Unites States is 'stronger than ever,' Netanyahu finally insisted, quelling fears of a rift between his Likud Party and Obama's Democratic Party. He insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong.' 'My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the office that he holds. I have great respect for both,' he said. 'I deeply appreciate all the President Obama has done for Israel: Security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support in the UN and much more.' 'The last thing anyone who cares about Israel, the last thing that I would want, is for Israel to become a partisan issue,' he added, 'and I regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that. Israel has always been a bipartisan issue. Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.' Netanyahu addressed the gathering Monday morning at the Walter E. Williams Convention Center, bracketed by remarks from two senior U.S. officials: Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. The Obama administration hedged  last week about whether it would send someone to speak, and who it might be, after Daily Mail Online raised the subject during a White House briefing. Power insisted that 'The United States of America will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, period.' 'Talks, no talks, agreement, no agreement, the United States will take whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security and that of our closest allies,' she said to an audience of thousands. 'We believe diplomacy is the preferred route to secure our shared aim. But if diplomacy fails, we know the stakes of a nuclear-armed Iran as well as everyone here. We will not let it happen. There will never be a sunset on America's commitment to Israel's security. Never.' She also criticized Netanyahu for 'politicizing' the Iran debate, saying U.S.-Israeli relations 'should never be politicized and it cannot and will not be tarnished or broken.' Netanyahu's visit to Washington has sparked criticism in both the U.S. and Israel. The centerpiece of his trip is an address to Congress Tuesday, which came at the invitation of congressional Republicans and was not coordinated with the White House. HOUSE MEMBERS . Rep.

Jeremy Bird, deputy director  of Organizing for America, is helping Netanyahu's opponents in the hope of defeating him, even as the White House insists Obama won't meet with the prime minister in order to avoid the appearance of prejudicing the election . Neither President Obama nor Vice President Biden will meet with the prime minister while he's in Washington, citing a desire to avoid the appearance of picking a side in Israel's upcoming elections. A close Obama adviser, though, former presidential campaign aide Jeremy Bird, is in Israel working to help Netanyahu's opposition defeat him. Rice has been particularly sharp in her criticism of Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, calling the move 'destructive' to the fabric of the U.S.-Israel relationship. The Israeli leader is deeply suspicious of Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, fearing the U.S. and its negotiating partners are prepared to leave Tehran on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon. A Netanyahu adviser told reporters traveling to Washington with the prime minister on Sunday that he was not coming to the U.S. capital to offend Obama. 'The prime minister is here to warn, in front of any stage possible, the dangers' of the agreement that may be taking shape, the adviser said, speaking anonymously under a policy that bars the official from speaking on the record. Netanyahu outlined policy differences with the White House on Monday . Pro-Palestine demonstrators wore Netanyahu masks and showed symbolic 'blood stained hands' on Sunday during protests led by Code Pink . The adviser said Israel was well aware of the details of the emerging nuclear deal and they included Western compromises that were dangerous for Israel. Still, he tried to lower tensions by saying that Israel 'does not oppose every deal' and was merely doing its best to warn the U.S. of the risks entailed in the current one. As Netanyahu was preparing to speak, Secretary of State John Kerry was in Switzerland for another round of talks with Iran. The U.S. is seeking to secure a framework agreement to curtail Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief ahead of a late-March deadline. The U.S. is negotiating alongside Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China.",

        "input_text": "Prosecutors want panels of the boat in which Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding to be brought to court to show jurors what they say is his written confession. His lawyers want them to see the entire bullet-ridden boat. Prosecutors have said Tsarnaev scrawled the motive for the attack inside the boat. They say he referred to U.S. wars in Muslim countries and wrote, among other things, 'Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.' Scroll down for video . Prosecutors say alleged Boston Bomber Dzokhar Tsarnaev (right) confessed to the attack in a scrawled message inside the boat where he was taken into custody. A view of the bloodied and bullet-ridden message seen on the left in an image obtained by ABC . Above, another view of the boat message which reads in part: 'We Muslims are one body. You kill one of us you hurt us all.' Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, had been killed hours earlier during a shootout with police, but Tsarnaev escaped and was captured — bloodied and wounded — inside a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown. During a final pretrial hearing Monday, Tsarnaev attorney William Fick objected to the plan to bring pieces of the boat to court and suggested instead that the boat be brought to the courthouse so the jury can see the entire boat. He argued that the jury would be seeing the writing out of context if the panels were brought into the courtroom. To see the whole boat would allow the jury to imagine Tsarnaev lying inside 'much like someone lying in a crypt making those writings,' Fick said. Attorneys for Tsarnaev want the entire boat where their client was arrested brought to court to the jury can see how torn up it was in the firefight with police . Above, a picture of the moment Tsarnaev was taken into custody outside of the boat in Watertown . Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb argued that it would be impractical to bring the entire boat to the courthouse and that there are photographs of it that can be shown to the jury. He suggested that the defense wants the jury to see the boat —which contains bullet holes, blood stains and broken glass — to gain sympathy for Tsarnaev. Tsarnaev's lawyers also asked Judge George O'Toole Jr. to exclude autopsy photos of the three people killed in the bombings. More than 260 people were hurt. 'These are highly sensitive, highly disturbing images,' said attorney Miriam Conrad. She said the defense will not dispute how the victims died. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said prosecutors have to prove that the victims died from the use of a weapon of mass destruction, which is among the charges against Tsarnaev.  She said the full-body autopsy photos are necessary because they show all the wounds. The judge did not immediately rule on the motions. Tsarnaev's lawyers made it clear during the hearing that they will portray Tsarnaev as an adoring younger brother who was coerced by his older brother into participating in the deadly 2013 attack. Although his lawyers had indicated they planned to argue that Dzhokhar, then 19, was influenced by Tamerlan, then 26, they used their strongest language to date to describe how they will depict the brothers' relationship and each of their roles in the attack. Tsarnaev's trial is set to start Wednesday and is expected to last about three to four months. Tsarnaev pictured above in court on January 15, 2015 . Tsarnaev attorney David Bruck said prosecutors are trying to show a 'completely distorted' picture of his client by asking the judge to limit the kind of evidence they can present during the initial phase of the trial, when the jury will be asked to decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of 30 charges. Bruck, arguing that the defense should be entitled to present evidence of Tamerlan's role in the attack, called him the 'lead conspirator ... but for whom the Boston Marathon bombing would never have occurred.' Bruck said the defense should be allowed to present evidence that the motive 'may well have been the defendant's domination by, love for, adoration of, submissiveness to ... his older brother.' 'That is fair game,' Bruck said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty argued that the defense plans to try to include mitigating evidence during the guilt phase of the trial, when that should be reserved for the second phase of the trial — known as the penalty phase — when the jury will be asked to decide Tsarnaev's punishment: life in prison or the death penalty. Opening statements in Tsarnaev's trial are scheduled for Wednesday. The trial is expected to last three to four months.",

        "input_text": "Any pending legal appeals will not delay the execution of the Bali Nine duo and the eight other drug smuggles, the Indonesian Attorney General has confirmed. This comes as Bali's chief prosecutor Momock Bambang Samiarso announced Australian death row inmates Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be moved to 'Death Island' where they will be executed this week. HM Prasetyo also confirmed that the preparations for the mass death by firing squad were '95 per cent' ready as Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers are planning to lodge an appeal within the next week. Scroll down for video . Final journey: The strain shows on the faces of Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right), pictured in Kerobokan prison this week in Kerobokan prison with Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) who can do nothing to save them from execution which now seems set for this weekend . In waiting: Seen from the waters off Nuskambangan in central Java this is the police station on the 30km long island which houses seven prisons, including Batu or 'stone' prison where special isolation cells have been prepared for the Australian Bali 9 duo ahead of the deaths by firing squad . However, HM Prasetyo said following the clemency plea rejection there were no more 'no more legal avenues left', The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 'Regarding the transfer (of Chan and Sukumaran), it will be done as soon as possible,' he said. 'It's all related to technical issues. Maybe there are still some things that need to be prepared. As an Indonesian battleship is due to arrive in the waters off Nusakambangan island in southern central Java, Mr Samiarso said that for the first time Attorney General M. Prasetyo had issued him with an order to to move the Bali Nine duo to the island. He said a meeting would take place on Monday to set the date of the transfer. Before they depart, Chan and Sukumaran will take part in a Hindu ceremony at Kerobokan prison in Bali at which offerings of flowers and food will be given and prayers will be made asking for the blessing of the gods. Grisly business: Dressed in civvies to play their roles as Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, two police officers from Indonesia's mobile brigade take part in a dress rehearsal for the men's removal to Nusakambangan island for their execution along with eight other drug traffickers . The two Australians have a 900km journey from Bali where they have lived for the last decade, west to the port town of Cilacap from where they will be transferred to the prison island and place of their execution, Nusakambangan . This comes as gruesome details of the planned executions comes to light. The two Australians and eight others will be executed in similar fashion to five foreigners and an Indonesian woman killed by firing squad on the island on January 18. Four of the  prisoners were strapped to wooden planks with a type of rubber used to make the inside of car tyres. Indonesian Rani Andriani aka Melisa Aprilia, opted not to be attached to a board, saying in a written submission beforehand 'submission does not mean give up. Do the best, God will finish the rest'. Last rites: Kerobokan prison (pictured, this week) will hold a special Hindu ceremony for Chan and Sukumaran asking the gods to bless the men before they make their final journey to their deaths . Is all hope lost? Bali's chief prosecutor says he is now certain that Myuran Sukumaran (above, left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be moved from Bali to Nusakambangan Island this week to be out to the firing squad . A masked member of the mobile paramilitary brigade 'Brimob' armed with an assault rifle will be among 22 officers who will accompany Chan and Sukumaran from Kerobokan prison to Denpasar airport, which they last saw ten years ago on arrival for their ill-fated heroin smuggling trip . These armed personnel carriers belonging to the Indonesian special police will be used in the transfer of the two Australians to Bali's airport whereupon they will be placed in Sukhoi jets and likely flown straight to Cilacap, which is just a short trip to their place of execution, Nusakambangan . Another woman, Vietnamese Tran Thi Bich Hanh who was executed on the same night but at Boyolali on the mainland in central Java, said in a final submission, 'whenever God wants me to die I am ready'. News emerging from Cilacap, the nearest port to Nuskambangan island, is that the town is filling up with Indonesian Navy special forces. Mr Samiarso said Nuskambangan, which houses seven prisons amid thick rain forest on the 30km long island, was now ready to receive Chan and Sukumaran. 'Everything is ready,' he said, reports Nine news, 'it will be this week for sure.' Indonesian police carry out an ant-terrorist drill at Pasir Putih prison, the 'supermax' of Nuskambangan's seven correctional facilities on the island where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shot this week . After weeks of deadly anticipation it appears that Nusakambangan, where police were pictured (above) this week taking part in an anti-terrorist drill is finally ready to carry out the deaths by firing squad of ten drug traffickers including the Australians Chan and Sukumaran . Indonesia plans to  hold the Australians and eight other convicted drug traffickers in one of the island's prisons before they are simultaneously killed by firing squads in the middle of the night. The prisons boss for Central java provence, Ahmad Yuspahruddin,confirmed last week that special isolation cells had been prepared for the Australian pair or Batu, or 'stone' prison away from the jail's other inmates weho weren't on death row. The transfer of Chan and Sukumaran to Nusakambangan, which had been predicted more than a week ago, was delayed by the logistics of carrying out the execution of ten people at once. Myuran Sukumaran pictured in 2006 just after the death sentence had been passed on him and Andrew Chan, less than a year after the pair and the seven drug mules they consigned to carry 8.3kg of heroin into Australia had been caught and jailed . The men spent time with family members, although Sukumaran's father, Sam and siblings, brother Chinthu and sister Brinthe returned to Australia on Sunday. Last Friday, Indonesia's mobile paramilitary brigade, Brimob, who will carry out the executions, staged a dress rehearsal in Bali to demonstrate how the Australian drug smugglers will be transferred from Kerobokan jail to the execution island. In the exercise, 22 heavily-armed officers clad in balaclavas took the 'prisoners', played by two police officers, on and off a military plane, represented by a bus. If Mr Samiarso's statement is correct, pleas for clemency by Australia's foreign minister Julie Bishop and, in a phone call directly to Indonesian president Joko Widowo, Prime Minister Tony Abbott, havefallen on deaf ears. Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 34, were the leaders of an 8.3kg heroin trafficking ring dubbed the 'Bali 9' who were convicted of attempting to smuggle the drugs out of Indonesia to Australia in 2005. They were sentenced to death in February 2006 and have been living in Kerobokan prison. The other eight due to face the firing squad are: Filipina Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami, Serge Areski Atlaoui of France, Martin Anderson of Ghana, Indonesian Zainal Abidin, Silvester Obikwe of Nigeria and Rodrigo Gularte, a paranoid schizophrenic man from Brazil whose family has desperately fought to be transferred to a hospital.",

        "input_text": "A mysterious skeleton found buried inside a lead coffin beside the remains of Richard III could belong to a revered holy woman who was said to reduce time spent in purgatory for those that prayed for her soul. Archaeologists believe the elderly woman, whose lead coffin was inlaid with a crucifix, may have been buried nearly 200 years before the last Plantagenet king of England. Her coffin was discovered within a limestone sarcophagus under a car park in Leicester city centre on what was the site of the Grey Friars church, just feet from Richard III's grave. Scroll down for videos . The lead coffin, inlaid with a crucifix (top) was found just feet from the remains of Richard III. Inside was the skeleton of a woman who is thought to have died in her 60s about 200 years before the Plantagenet king . She was one of nine women found to have been buried within the medieval complex around the hastily dug final resting place of Richard III. However, radiocarbon dating shows she may been buried not long after the church was first built 1250 - nearly two centuries before Richard III died. The blow that killed King Richard III in battle was so powerful that it went up through the base of his brain and left an indentation on the inside of his skull, scientists studying his remains have revealed. Forensic pathologists at University of Leicester, discovered two wounds at the base of the king's skull along with a large indentation inside the cranium. The findings suggest that a weapon such as a sword or a spike had been thrust upwards through the base of the king's neck so hard that it had gone straight through his brain to the other side of his skull. Genetic analysis of the battle scarred skeleton, discovered under a council car park in Leicester three years ago, has confirmed that it did belong to Richard III. Scientists studying the remains believe the king was surrounded by a mob of enemy soldiers and hacked to death after he had lost his helmet. Using modern medical scanners, they established that the English monarch suffered 11 devastating injuries at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Analysis of isotopes preserved in her remains by researchers at the University of Leicester has shown that the woman was show that she had lived a privileged life, eating plenty of protein and large amounts of sea fish. It is thought that she had died in her 60s. This suggests she had been wealthy and had been carefully buried in a prominent position under the choir of the friary and close to the high altar. This all suggests she had special significant to the Catholic order and may have been an early benefactor of the friary, archaeologists leading the excavation believe. They have found clues that suggest one of the women buried there was highly revered. Records dating back to around the time the monastery was founded, more than 700 years ago, show that the Bishop of Lincoln offered a 30 day indulgence for anyone who would pray for a woman buried beneath a Franciscan Church in Leicester. Dated to 1250, it offered a month off the pains of purgatory for anyone who would say 'a Pater and a Ave for the soul of Emma, wife of John of Holt, whose body is buried in the Franciscan church in Leicester'. However, according to Mathew Morris, lead archaeologist at Leicester University and site director for the excavation, she is thought to be from Nevill Holt in Leicestershire. However, little more is known about Emma Holt, and it was likely none of women found buried under Grey Friars will ever be completely identified. He said: 'We don't know much more about her. We know she was buried around 1290 in the friary church, but we don't know her age at death, what she did for a living or what she looked like. The lead coffin was found inside a limestone sarcophagus (above) under the choir of the Grey Friars church . Archaeologists had to carefully remove stone lid on top the coffin (above) in order to exhume the body . The lead coffin had been damaged by water around the feet (above) causing the skeleton to become damaged . 'We don't have any known descendants who can provide a DNA sample, so despite having a known woman buried here and a skeleton with a set of attributes we cannot link the two together. 'Unfortunately this skeleton will always remain anonymous.' The twisted and battled scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered in a shallow grave beneath the site of the friary in 2012. Subsequent DNA work has positively confirmed the skeleton as belonging to the Plantagenet king. He had been buried in a crudely dug grave within the church in 1485. Further excavations on the site in August 2013, however, revealed the sarcophagus containing the mystery elderly woman. A further eight graves containing women were found around the spot where Richard III had been buried. Scientists believe their could be at least seven more graves on the site of the old Grey Friars church, which was being used as a car park when archaeologists began excavating in their search for the body of Richard III . The sarcophagus was first uncovered in 2012 at the same time as Richard III but due to bad weather archaeologists had to wait until the following year before being able to return to begin excavating the coffin . Mr Morris said: 'What stands out more is the contrast between the care and attention taken with these burials – large, neatly dug graves with coffins – and the crudeness of Richard III’s grave. 'The more we examine it, the clearer it becomes how atypical Richard III’s burial really was.' In total archaeologists exhumed three of the women found buried on the site of Grey Friars and left six undisturbed. Two graves, inside the choir, contained wooden coffins with a woman inside each aged between 40 and 50 years old. Radiocarbon dating shows that they probably died between 1270 and 1400, while osteological analysis of the bones show that one of the women had a congenital hip dislocation that would have forced her to walk with a crutch. The other woman was found to have lived a life of hard physical labour, regularly using her arms and legs to life heavy weights. The stonework of the sarcophagus had cracked and crumbled (shown above) due to the weight of the lid . Mathew Morris (above) led the excavation, which was done by hand rather than using heavy lifting machinery . Archaeologists uncovered Medieval floor tiles during the excavation that they believe would have formed the floor of the friary under which the body of Richard III and the women found on the site were buried . Another skeleton, which had been disturbed and reburied in early building work, also showed signs of hard physical work and is believed to have died in her mid-20s. However, it was the coffin found within the stone sarcophagus that has attracted most attention from archaeologists. It is the first to be found in Leicester in a modern excavation. Mr Morris said: 'The stone sarcophagus was a tapered box carved from a single block of limestone. Inside, the wider end was curved, creating a broad head niche. 'Unfortunately, the stone lid did not properly fit the coffin allowing water to get inside, and its immense weight had badly cracked the sarcophagus, meaning it could not be lifted intact. 'However, inside the inner lead coffin was undamaged except for a hole at the foot end of the casket where the lead had decayed and collapsed inward exposing the skeleton’s feet.' Initially the coffin was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary to be examined for an endoscope in case any tissue had been preserved. Mr Morris said that while the body had decayed to leave only a skeleton, fragments of cloth and hair were still intact. He said: 'Opening a lead coffin was an interesting experience. It is a little like opening a tin can. There were a few fragments of linen or cloth and cord - these might be the remains of the shroud. A little bit of hair survived as well. 'A grave like this you have go to think this person was important to the friars. We know this woman was over 60 when she died. Stable isotope analysis of her bones suggest she had a very high status diet and she was eating a lot of fish and meat. 'When you compare her diet with Richard III it is only just below his adult diet.'",

Will Page, described as a 'car fanatic' by his family, was driving out of an industrial estate in Ilkeston in Derbyshire when a parking barrier swung into the windscreen of his van, trapping him and crushing him to death. The 22-year-old apprentice engineer had been repairing a car on the industrial estate when the accident happened on Saturday. His girlfriend Rachael Cross, and mother of their unborn child, described him as 'just amazing' and said it was a 'dream' for her partner to become a father. Will Page had been celebrating with his family the news that his girlfriend Rachael Cross (left) was pregnant with their first child, when hours later the car enthusiast was crushed to death by a parking barrier . Just hours earlier on the previous day Mr Page had been celebrating with his family after he revealed that his 21-year-old girlfriend Rachael Cross was eight weeks pregnant with their first child. She was due to have her first scan yesterday. Mr Page's father Brian said: 'One minute he was telling everyone he was having a baby and over the moon - and the next this happened. 'He loved kids and being a father was everything he wanted. Everyone said he would have been a great dad.' Mr Page frequently met up with other car fanatics at Wyvern retail park in Derby during the weekends. On Sunday evening about 90 cars took part in a procession past his Derbyshire home and beeped their horns in his honour before gathering at the retail park, writing messages to put in lanterns and releasing them into the sky. His father added: 'From front to back, the cars went on for two-and-a-half miles. I stood outside and watched them all come past. He would have been over the moon with that. Mr Page was said to be looking forward to the birth of his first child with girlfriend Rachael Cross (right) Flowers have been left at the industrial site in Ilkeston where the parking barrier (right) swung into his van . 'It was truly astounding and so emotional. It made me feel so much better because he was loved by so many. 'Will was such a happy-go-lucky child, right up to his death, forever smiling and laughing. 'He was the typical joker type of lad and would do anything to cheer people up. 'You couldn't find a better son, mate, brother or leader - he was well-thought-of by so many people.' On Monday Miss Cross posted an image of her eight week scan on Facebook and said their 'little fighter has a strong heartbeat, even after all this stress.' Miss Cross said she had paid for the private scan so that the image could be buried with her partner. She said: 'He was absolutely amazing and I just loved him so much. 'It was a complete dream for him to be a dad and obviously I'm still going to make that happen. 'He was just so happy and never put a downer on your day. I keep expecting him to walk through the door and say 'what's everyone moping about for?''' The couple met in 2013 over their mutual love of cars and have been living with Mr Page's father but saving up to buy their own home. Miss Cross added: 'He was brilliant with kids and would have been a great dad. Mr Page's father said the young apprentice engineer was a car fanatic and would have been a good father . Miss Cross shared a picture of her eight week scan on Facebook on Monday - two days after Mr Page died . 'We spoke about becoming a family one day and when he found out I was pregnant he was absolutely over the moon.' She said the last thing her boyfriend had told her was that he loved her. 'We hadn't been trying for a baby but we had talked about it,' said Miss Cross. 'Will just said if it happens it happens and when I found out I was pregnant he was delighted and it felt like it was meant to be. On the Saturday morning when the accident happened he'd left me in bed at eight o'clock while he went off to do up his car. 'His last words to me were 'love you, bye' and off he went.. That was the last time I saw him. I was having a lie in and I got a call from one of his friends at about 11am saying Will had been in an accident. 'To be honest I just laughed because he was always playing jokes on me pretending he'd cut his finger off at work and I thought it was another prank. When his friend told me he was serious I rushed down to the scene but it was too late. The paramedics were doing CPR on him but he'd passed away. The Health and Safety Executive is investigating how the parking barrier swung into Mr Page's windscreen . Flowers have been left at the scene of the accident following the young apprentice's death on Saturday . Mr Page's friends left flowers, cuddly toys (left) and a t-shirt (right) in tribute to the tragic 22-year-old . Some left bottles of cider and items to remember Mr Page (left) while others placed notes and flowers (right) 'He'd been going in and out of the industrial unit all morning. The barrier was one where you're supposed to bolt it back when you go through but Will hadn't done that. When he came out of the unit to get another part for the car a big gust of wind blew the barrier and it went straight through the windscreen. 'There was nothing anyone could do.' Mr Page had been carrying out repairs on his Peugeot 106 GTI when the accident took place. He had been in a work van and was driving out of the site when the barrier crashed through the windscreen, trapping him in the vehicle and crushing him. Firefighters, police, paramedics and the air ambulance were called to the scene, but Mr Page was pronounced dead at 11.15am. The Health and Safety Executive is investigating how the accident took place. Mr Page has two brothers - Callum, 25, and Harry, 18 - as well as 27-year-old sister Laura. His friend Lee Harris, 28, of Ilkeston, worked with him for about five years at A&D Plastics in Digby Business Park. He said: 'It is not something you expect to hear. When I found out he had been involved in an incident, I walked up there thinking he had broken his leg. You do not think the worst. Mr Page had been repairing his Peugeot 106 at the Ilkeston industrial site before the apparent freak accident . 'It was when I found out he was trapped that I realised it was bad. He was a great lad, I always got on with him and he one of those people you bond with through work. My brother Daniel was his best mate. They did everything together; fishing and holidays.' Dave Harris, who knew the apprentice through his nephew Lee and working with him at A&D Plastics, said he was often known by the nickname 'little Will.' He told the Nottingham Post: 'He was always mucking about with his cars - he was really into his cars. 'We called him little Will because he was so small until he was about 16 and then he sprouted up.' Andy Wilmott, managing director of WB Power Services where the 22-year-old worked, said: 'He was a lovely lad and everyone here is absolutely devastated. Flowers have been left by friends and relatives at the scene (left) where Mr Page (right) died on Saturday . 'He was a trustworthy guy and very infectious. He had a lot of friends here and a lot of people liked him.' A spokeswoman from the Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland Air Ambulance confirmed Mr Page died at the scene after suffering chest injuries. She said: 'We are not sure how it happened. The barrier went through the windshield and crushed him.' A man who works at the garage where Will was repairing his car said: 'We're not entirely sure what's happened but he was driving out when he was hit by the barrier. 'It might have been the wind that caught the barrier and swung it into his van.' A fundraising page has been set up to raise money for Mr Page's funeral and has already raised £2,400 in his memory in just two days.",

Barack Obama's recent executive orders on immigration. The House, 257-167, backed a Senate-passed funding . bill stripped of any immigration provisions, ending a bitter . fight that raised new questions about House Speaker John . Boehner's ability to manage fractious conservatives, who accused him of 'capitulation' after the Tuesday vote . Obama has said he will sign the funding bill for the . Department of Homeland Security, which spearheads domestic . counterterrorism efforts. Spending authority for the department . was scheduled to end at midnight on Friday. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio walks to the House chamber on Tuesday as it votes on funding for the Homeland Security Department without provisions attached to counter President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.  They suffered embarrassing internal divisions that left the country within hours of a partial agency shutdown last week but passed a full fiscal-year funding bill today . The agency came within hours of a partial shutdown last week but the House approved a one-week extension of funding that was later approved by voice vote in the Senate and signed into law by the president. The drama began in December when the legislative branch passed a measure appropriating money to every single government agency through Sept. 30 but DHS, which it only funded through the end of February. Republicans hoped that once they took the majority in January they would have the resources to use the spending bill as a cudgel against Democrats. Yet after weeks of bickering, Boehner ultimately found himself last week  with few - . if any - viable procedural options to keep the agency open while . also satisfying conservatives who wanted the funding bill to . block Obama's executive actions last year lifting the threat of . deportation for millions of undocumented residents. Senate Democrats had repeatedly blocked a House-passed bill . that included the immigration provisions, while Obama and . Democrats backed a 'clean' funding bill passed by the Senate. 'What direction do we have?' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on Tuesday. Meanwhile, many of the GOP's rank and file seemed ready for the whole debacle to be over. 'It's time to move forward and stop playing these silly games,' Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Pennsylvania Republican, said. 'Let's prove to the American people that we're serious about protecting this homeland and that we have the capacity to govern.' 'Sanity is prevailing. I do give John Boehner credit,' New York Rep. Peter King said. Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho said he's against Obama's immigration directives, but the 'security of the homeland is one of our highest priorities.' Several Republicans said they would be better served by . putting their energy into legal strategies to overturn Obama's . immigration actions, which have been put on hold by the courts. 'This is where we must focus our actions,' said Republican . Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid applauded the passage of the House bill while opining that 'many weeks were wasted on political games that left us staring a Homeland Security shutdown square in the face.' 'If this ordeal teaches us one thing, it is that for the sake of our country we must stop governing by crisis,' he said, calling it an 'unnecessary showdown.' 'Common ground should be something we seek, not run away from – especially when the security of our nation is at stake. If we are going to get anything done, we must not be afraid of working together.' Taking a victory lap, Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine said in a statement that he looked forward to working with his fellow senators reforming the immigration process 'now that DHS funding is no longer being held hostage over the President’s immigration executive action.' Department of Homeland Security Chief Jeh Johnson said early Tuesday evening in a statement that Congress 'has done a good thing.' The Obama administration official thanked members 'who showed the leadership necessary to get the job done' and gave DHS personnel a 'vote of confidence in the importance of their work.' 'Now our men and women can return to the vital work of combatting terrorism, ensuring border security, port security, aviation security, cybersecurity, and our other vital homeland security missions, without the uncertainty of a furlough or a delayed paycheck hanging over their heads,' he said. Boehner went from high-flying on Tuesday to chagrined. He's pictured here on Tuesday morning with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after a joint meeting of Congress on Capitol Hill. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah applauds at right . Some conservatives said the House was making a mistake . by caving to Democrats' demands in the immigration battle. 'Yes, the recent court action gives us some hope that the Judicial Branch will finally rein in this lawless president,' Alabama Rep. Martha Roby said in a statement. 'However, I believe Congress had a responsibility to use its appropriations authority to stop this lawlessness and uphold the checks and balances that exist to protect liberty.' 'This is a very, very sad day,' said Republican . Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona. 'If we're not going to . fight now, when are we going to fight?' Conservative firebrand Steve King of Iowa argued that 'this is the signal of capitulation.' 'The mood of this thing is such that to bring it back from the abyss is very difficult.' House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte said he voted against the bill because 'the stakes are too high to surrender.' 'This fight is not about immigration; it’s about the Constitution and preserving the rule of law,' he asserted. 'If we don’t stop President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration, future presidents will continue to expand the power of the Executive Branch and encroach upon individual liberty. Goodlatte, a Virginia Republicans, said Congress must use 'all the tools' at its 'disposal to stop the President’s egregious abuse of authority.' His committee will consider a bill later this week that would prohibit the federal government from using funds to enact Obama's mandates. 'We must do all we can within our constitutional authority to stop President Obama’s lawlessness,' he said. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, the greatest detractor of Obama's immigration actions in the upper chamber, vowed on Tuesday to keep battling. 'When it comes to defending our sovereignty there is no \"moving on,\" ' he said just before the House vote. 'Now is not the time for recrimination; now is the time for renewed determination.' 'Those who think this fight is over could not be more mistaken; it is only beginning,' he stated. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, center, flanked by Senator Chuck Schumer, left, and Dick Durbin, right, is pictured here on Tuesday at the Capitol. Reid applauded the passage of the House bill on Tuesday while opining that 'many weeks were wasted on political games that left us staring a Homeland Security shutdown square in the face.' Boehner told . Republican House members at a meeting on Tuesday that he wished they had more time to battle Obama but it was . time to allow a vote on the provision-free Senate bill. 'I am as outraged and frustrated as you at the lawless and unconstitutional actions of this president,' Boehner told his caucus, according to aides who spoke to the Associated Press. However, he said, 'I believe this decision — considering where we are — is the right one for this team, and the right one for this country.' 'Imagine if, God forbid, another terrorist attack hits the United States.' Rep. Luke Messer of Indiana, who chairs the Republican Policy Committee, offered a similar version of events to Reuters. 'The speaker made the case that he had hoped to continue to . fight for three more weeks. Obviously we didn't win that vote . last week, so we are where we are.' 'It's disappointing. I had hoped we'd be able to continue to . fight,' he said. Boehner allowed the use of a procedural motion to bring up . the Senate's funding bill, which passed the House with support . from both moderate Republicans and House Democrats. The bill provides nearly $40 billion in funding for the . agency, created after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that secures . U.S. borders, airports, coastal waters and other critical . facilities. Without the funding, the agency would have been forced to . furlough about 30,000 employees, or about 15 percent of the . agency's workforce.

Mexican security forces moved in on the hideout in Morelia, Michoacán on February 27, and were able to capture Martinez without firing a single shot. Scroll down for video . Servando Gómez Martínez (above), Mexico's most-wanted drug lord, was captured by authorities hiding out on a farm on February 27 . Authorities were able to locate him as they had been monitoring the farm (above), and grew suspicious when his girlfriend dropped him off a birthday cake . Martinez, known as La Tuta, was the head of the Knights Templar cartel, and previously worked as an elementary school teacher . The Washington Post reports that it was not just the cake that confirmed the location of Martinez, but also the communication habits of one of his most trusted messengers. While Martinez, 49, never used a cell phone, one messenger did, and would frequently communicate on his device travelling to and from the farm. Unbeknownst to that messenger however, his phone was being tracked. 'Michoacan now is in a better position,' said Federal Police Commissioner Enrique Galindo Ceballos said. 'The important parts of the [cartel] structure are neutralized.' The arrest was also an incredibly big boost for President Enrique Pena Nieto as he tries to deal with the increased gang violence in the country. Though frequently on the move, and at times living in caves to evade the authorities, Martinez still loved the spotlight, and would often release videos in which he criticized the government for supporting other drug cartels. He was also known to hand over cash for favorable press. The elementary school teacher turned drug lord portrayed himself as a hero in the numerous interviews he granted the media, though in recent years the violence inflicted by members of his cartel had become far more vicious, leading to citizens of the country doing everything they could to help law enforcement in their efforts to take down the organization. He frequently granted interviews with the media criticizing the Mexican government, and would pay cash for favorable press . Martinez was also known to hide out in caves (above) to evade law enforcement . The arrest come less than a year after two of the cartel's most violent members, his sons Luis Alfredo Aguilera Esquivel and Huber Gómez Patiño, were captured by authorities. With this arrest authorities now believe the Knights Templar cartel may collapse, as almost all the organization's leaders have been captured. Martinez's group alone, La Familia Michoacana, controlled some 50 methamphetamine labs across Mexico while also making millions from a variety of illegal activities, among them extortion and kidnapping. The United States charged him under the Kingpin Act in 2010, making it illegal for any Americans or American companies to do business with him, and freezing all his assets in this country. Martinez is now being held in a maximum security prison. He had long said that he would rather be killed than put behind bars. Flavio Gomez, Martinez's brother, was arrested during the same raid.",

He is furious with prison officials because he says they refuse to allow him to leave the prison to get the surgery he can only get on the outside. let him get medical care outside. And now, OJ fears he will soon be in a wheelchair and may never walk again. OJ, 67, was recently seen struggling to walk around the prison with a cane and telling fellow inmates he was angry because he is not getting the specialized medical care he needs. Scroll down for video . Fallen idol: OJ Simpson says that without getting the special surgery he needs he will never be able to walk out of the prison on his own two feet. He is currently serving a nine-to-33-year sentence in state prison as a result of his 2008 conviction for armed robbery and kidnapping, but he could be out in two years . Painful: OJ's knee injuries are a result from his 11-year career as a running back in the NFL. He doesn't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to walk to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane while grimacing in pain . On display: OJ's knee injuries had such an impact on his health, attorney Johnnie Cochran, used his disability in his trial for the murder of wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. to convince the jury that he was not physically capable of  the killings. At one point Cochran instructed OJ to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped . OJ was found guilty in 2008 of criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, assault, robbery and using a deadly weapon and was sentenced to thirty-three years in prison with the possibility of parole after nine years, in 2017. 'I can only get mediocre health care in here,' OJ told a fellow inmate, 'and it really pisses me off because I have the money to go to any specialist in the world to get knee surgery but they won't let me leave to get help. 'They don't give a damn that I am going to end up crippled and can't walk for the rest of my life' A prison insider tells Daily Mail Online, OJ doesn't walk around the prison a lot like he used to but when he has to get his meals in the commissary he walks with a new silver cane, grimacing in pain. OJ stops frequently to lean up against the wall to rest if there is not a bench nearby to sit and complains the pain is getting worse every day. OJ is given pain medication but it only helps him sleep, it doesn't make the pain go away during the day. And OJ's girth doesn't help. Says the prison insider, 'OJ started gaining weight  because he was eating pork-n-beans, breads and a lot of sweets, like cookies and ice cream but now that he can't get any exercise he has ballooned up to almost 340 pounds. 'When there was nice weather OJ used to walk around the track on the prison yard for an hour at a time but now the pain in his knee is so severe he can barely walk ten steps without moaning in pain. OJ's weight is definitely a factor and putting more stress on his knees but he also has advanced arthritis.' OJ's knee injuries are a result from his 11-year career as a running back in the NFL and although he has gone through two surgeries on his left knee in the late 1970's he is still in extreme pain. These injuries had such an impact on his health OJ's attorney, Johnnie Cochran, Jr., used his disability in his murder trial 20 years ago to convince the jury his knee was so weak that he was not physically capable of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. At one point Johnnie instructed OJ to stand and raise his suit pant leg to show the jury his multiple scars on his left knee to prove he was severely handicapped. OJ may be getting released from prison in 2017 on parole and he's telling the other inmates it looks like he's going to be leaving there in a wheelchair. OJ Simpson, then with the  Buffalo Bills,  is carried off the field at the end of the half. This is not the first time that his pal Al Cowlings (at right, No. 82) helped take him away. He was along on the low-speed chase in the Bronco 'following the murders . OJ is not in jail for the murder of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson but for criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, assault, robbery and using a deadly weapon years later . 'I won't be out of here for at least another two years and if they won't let me get to a specialist soon I may never walk again!' OJ slammed his fists down on the table, revealed the insider. 'I have the money to pay for any surgery I need and the transportation so it won't be on the freakin' tax payers but they are still saying 'No.' 'Most of the time if a patient gets a recommendation from a doctor to have surgery but it is not life-threatening, the prison will deny that request,' the insider added. 'OJ said they just gave him a pill and told him to take it easy. 'Hehas talked to his attorneys about going to court so he can get some outside medical help but by the time the courts decide he may be already on parole. 'OJ is in bad shape and it's only going to get worse. The pain is excruciating and his knee is so deformed that he cant even straighten his left leg anymore. 'OJ is so worried about being seen in a wheelchair that he said he is not going to tell anyone, not even his family, when he's leaving Lovelock. 'OJ said when he gets parole he will leave in the middle of the night so he can disappear and there will not be any pictures of an old man a wheelchair on the cover of every newspaper across this country with the caption, 'The Juice - Old and Broken!'",

Trinity Bachamann, 13, of Apopka, Florida, was struck dead as she sat in the street arguing with her mother, Janice Perdoza, about who would sit in the front seat of the car. Perdoza, 36, was also injured in the accident and hospitalized, but has since been released. Scroll down for video . Trinity Bachamann (above) was killed Saturday night as she sat in the middle of the road arguing with her mother . The young girl's friends set up a memorial at the site (above) where Trinity was hit by a driver who 'had the odor of alcohol on her breath and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot' Apopka police told WKMG that the pair were struck by a 21-year-old woman who 'had the odor of alcohol on her breath and her eyes were glassy and bloodshot.' They also found an open bottle of Mike's Hard Lemonade in the center console of her car. Trinity, an eighth-grader at Apopka Middle School, was upset with her mother after she was refused a spot in the front seat while driving home from a friend's house. Though three miles from home, the young girl got out of the car refusing to get back in, despite her mother's pleas. She then sat down in the middle of the road, refusing to move. 'We heard arguing going on and stepped outside,' said Jackie Suggs, who lives across the street from the scene of the accident. 'Somebody said \"get outta here,\" and next thing you know, bam! She got hit and flew up in the air. It was awful.' The driver of the car, who did stop after the incident, was given a blood test on the scene. Authorities are awaiting the results of that test before charging the woman, and said the accident is under investigation. 'She was lifeless, right there, just lifeless,' added Suggs. 'And her mom was just panicking. Screaming.' The scene of the incident was dark (above) and the teenager was wearing dark clothing noted one passerby . Pizza driver Michael Bryan, 25, said he also saw the girl sitting in the road, but not until the very last second. 'I couldn't see her clearly until I passed them,' he told the Orlando Sentinel, explaining the the road was poorly lit and the teen was wearing dark clothing at the time. Thinking that the car had broken down, he returned back to scene after dropping off his next delivery, but by then it was too late. Now, a Go Fund Me page has been set up for the family during this difficult time by Amy Shelly, who was one of Trinity's cheerleading coaches. 'A big personality, a huge heart,' is how Shelley described the popular young teenager. Friends of Trinity set up a memorial for the girl, who they remember as a 'firecracker' who loved to sing, at the scene of the accident, and grief counselors were made available at the middle school.",

        "input_text": "Yet another former model has publicly accused embattled entertainer Bill Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her on at least two occasions nearly 40 years ago. Cosby's latest accuser, known only as Patricia, was one of more than a dozen women who anonymously testified against the comedian as part of a 2005 lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand - a former basketball star and Temple University employee who was among the first people to call out Cosby. The multimillionaire TV star settled the lawsuit a year later for an undisclosed amount, and his accusers were effectively 'silenced,' said Patricia. Scroll down for video . More accusations: Yet another former model, a 58-year-old California resident named Patricia, has come out accusing Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting her in the late 1970s . More than 30 women have accused the 77-year-old award-winning comedian in recent years of sexually assaulting them over the past four decades. Cosby's legal team have repeatedly said their client denies all of the allegations of sexual misconduct. Speaking in an exclusive interview with BuzzFeed this week, Patricia, now 58 years old and living in California, finally got to tell her story involving the powerful show business big-shot who allegedly lured her to his home under the guise of an acting lesson and took advantage of her after spiking her drink. Patricia said she was 22 years old in 1978 when Cosby invited her to a dinner party at his home in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. The young model, who first met the famous comic while working as a conference planner at the University of Massachusetts - her and Cosby’s alma mater - assumed that the actor's wife, Camille, will be joining them for dinner. But when she arrived the Cosbys' house, Patrica said she found a table set just for two next to a fireplace. ‘I felt alarm bells go off because it did feel intimate, but I was trying to be so grown up and mature,' she told the site. Jane Doe: Patricia was one of more than a dozen women who anonymously testified against the comedian as part of a 2005 lawsuit filed by Andrea Constand (left and right) The young model accepted a drink from her famous host, who then proceeded to give her a set of peculiar acting directions: Patricia was asked to pretend to be a queen with oatmeal dripping down her face. 'It was so creepy,' Patricia told BuzzFeed. 'He told me to convince him that I could remain regal and queenlike no matter what I looked like.' As the odd improvisational game went on, Patricia said she started to feel strange and eventually blacked out. In a now-familiar scenario, Patricia said she later woke up naked in bed to find Cosby standing over her dressed in a robe. The comedian allegedly said that the young woman got sick and he had to remove and wash her soiled dress. She recalled that at the time, it sounded like a plausible explanation. On her way home after the disastrous dinner, Patricia got violently ill and had to pull over four times to throw up. Patricia, an aspiring singer and actress, said she felt embarrassed and was certain that Cosby would not want to help her anymore with her career in show business. But Cosby followed through on his promise to mentor her, paying for her acting lessons in New York and Los Angeles, getting her a gym membership to help her lose weight, and regularly checking up on her progress. Ideal: The last time Patricia saw Cosby in 1980, the comic allegedly requested that she style her hair like Queen Noor of Jordan (left and right) Regal: Patricia claimed  Cosby was 'obsessed' with the beautiful American-born consort of King Hussein, and that he even sent her a photo of the queen so that a hair stylist could replicate her loose bun . Patricia also accompanied the married actor to several events around the country. The last time she saw Cosby during a live taping of the Dinah Shore Show in 1980, the comedian had an odd request: Patricia was asked to style her hair like Queen Noor of Jordan. Patricia claimed that Cosby was 'obsessed' with the striking American-born consort of King Hussein, and that he even sent her a photo of the queen so that a hair stylist could replicate her loose bun. After the show taping, Patricia claimed that Cosby talked her into taking some pills to relax her. She awakened the next morning naked and knew at once that something was awry. 'I was very sick and knew that someone had penetrated me,' the ex-model told the site. Patricia then confronted Cosby, but the comedian became furious, accused her of being an ingrate and threw her out of his suite. The woman kept mum about her experiences for the next three decades, saying that she felt ashamed and partially responsible for what happened to her because she trusted the wrong person and let herself be blinded by ambition. Patricia finally broke her silence in 2005 after her therapist gave her the number of the detective investigating the allegations against Cosby. She then joined 13 other women who agreed to testify as part of Andrea Constand's five-count lawsuit against the beleaguered comic. Patricia has become the seventh Jane Doe to speak out. She hopes other alleged victims will follow her example and come out of the shadows. 'You're not alone,' she said. 'You don’t have to keep this a secret anymore.'",

But their personal life before their reality show fame was mired in violence, drugs and sexual abuse. The Teen Mom couple announced their engagement in December after Tyler surprised his sweetheart with an diamond engagement ring. Days later, Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Nova Reign. Their first child, Carly, now five, was given up for adoption when they were 16. Besides telling their story, the reformed couple offer wayward teenagers advice on growing up and 'breaking the cycle of dysfunction' in a new book, Conquering Chaos, published by Post Hill Press. Both Tyler, 24, and Catelynn, who turns 24 on March 12, grew up in different trailer parks in Port Huron, Michigan, but they both experienced the trailer park trash life of intoxicated parents deep into drug abuse, parental jail time and violence. Scroll down for video . Catelynn Lowell and fiancée Tyler Baltierra have been open about her mother and his father's battle with addiction. But they've never revealed the hell they experienced as children as a result or the terrifying habits their parents passed onto them. In their new memoir, Conquering Chaos, the Teen Mom fan-favorites, both 23, talk about witnessing drug-related gun fights, abusing ecstasy and cocaine and more . Out of control. Catelynn and Tyler admit they didn't give birth control much thought. They were using the pull-out method, and that was it. 'I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control,' writes Tyler. The Teen Mom and her boyfriend decided to give their baby up for adoption . Oh so innocent: Catelynn's mother was a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail. Tyler  became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking weed and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight . Catelynn says her mother was 'a b****' and a drunk often passed out on the floor, her father an alcoholic and crack addict who spent most of his time in jail. 'It was chaos all the time. I didn't like it, and I didn't thrive on it, but I was familiar with it. It was normal to me,' Catelynn writes. Tyler's father was a crack addict, a con artist, who spent most of his son's younger years in jail while his supportive mother cycled through boyfriends. So the little boy became a daycare delinquent at age five and was drinking, smoking week and cigarettes and taking drugs by age eight. The young couple fell in love at age twelve and 'we both ended up on the same wild ride'. 'Our decision to have sex — and the way we handled it — brought about a consequence that changed our lives forever.' The as-yet-unmarried childhood sweethearts had their second child, Nova on January 1 this year that they are raising, and decided to write about life before the cameras were rolling when they were terrified teenagers mired in the most extreme dysfunctional families in a seedy environment. Catelynn viewed herself as a social butterfly and opted for multiple boyfriends over passing grades in school although school helped her forget how miserable life was back at the trailer. Tyler spotted her when they were both in junior high, walked up and just took her hand. 'We just walked on ahead, holding hands, and we've been together ever since', he writes. 'Her smile lights up the room and her eyes are beautiful piercing gray. Plus, she's got bigger t**s than any other girl in the seventh grade. 'Definitely my kind of chick. I think to myself, \"I have to have her.\" He wrote her funny notes, cracked jokes, clowned around. He was more open than she was and he taught her to state her own opinions after years of smothering them and lying. 'So speaking my mind and sharing my feelings just wasn't at the top of my list of survival skills. It wasn't something that had gotten positive results in the past. Blowing smoke: Catelynn Lowell smokes on a bong at a gathering with friends in August 2012 . Baby joy: Catelynn gave birth to their second child, Nova Reign in January, days after they got engaged . 'For my whole life, I had a habit of telling people what I thought they wanted to hear, even if it wasn't the truth'. But they didn't start sleeping together until ten months later. Tyler was molested by an older girl, a friend of his older sister, when he was nine years old. 'One day I went over to her house with my sister and some other people, and for some reason or another, everyone else left but this older girl and me. For the next several hours, while we were alone together in her house, it was sex act after sex act after sex act. It went on all day. She had us doing everything she could think of, one thing after another. There'd be a break and then it would start up again. And when it was finally over, I didn't know what the hell had happened'. That incident left him wanting sex from girls who were only ten years old and if they didn't put out, he called them prudes and broke up with them. When Cate finally gave in to Tyler's sexual desires, it was gangbusters – 'banging in his mom's trailer'. 'Once we'd done it once, we were doing it all the time! After waiting so long we turned into crazy, horny teenagers. It was so bad,' she says. 'We would drink and party together and fool around constantly, all the time'. 'Unfortunately, we were not being safe at all', Tyler says. 'We were using the pull-out method, and that was it. I didn't wear condoms and Cate never went on birth control. 'We just didn't feel like we had to. My parents hadn't given me a real talk about it yet, and Cate's parents hadn't given her a talk. We went through sex education and everything, but I sort of thought I was an expert already. We are family: 'Nothing better than getting to spend the day with both of these amazing woman... my sister and my mother... family is EVERYTHING!,' Tyler posted on Instagram . 'We thought pulling out is good enough, and like typical dumb kids, we couldn't actually comprehend what would happen if it wasn't. 'We just approached sex like we'd taken the pills and the air duster. It was fun and it was available, so we did it, because the risks didn't really scare us. We were doing adult things with a child's level of understanding'. They were also consuming big quantities of drugs. He was smoking cigarettes and weed and drinking booze at age eight as well as 'huffin' air duster that he had stolen from CVS that make his head turn into a balloon. It caused him to have a seizure and pee all over himself. She smelled pot in her house at age ten and started getting high on the sleeping pill Unisom to trip out hallucinating, consuming five or six at a time. She snorted Ritalin – or anything else that happened to be around. 'And there was Robotrippin', where we chugged a bunch of cough syrup to get high. We did Ecstasy when we had that. Basically, anything we could get our hands on to get high with, we'd do it. 'I was a little behind on the air duster. I watched my friends do it for about a month, but I was kind of scared of it. But then I got curious to see what the big deal was, so I started doing that, too. 'We never really drank much, funny enough. We did everything else we could get, huffin', snorting pills, smoking weed, we were all about that stuff. But even our friends weren't really drinking. Why drink when you can huff air duster?' – was her thought. Happy reunion: Catelynn and Tyler's reunion with their biological daughter was filled with joy, smiles and plenty of happy tears . She was just trekking down the same drug route that generations of her relatives had traveled for years. He was in the same boat. 'It would have been better not to mess around with air duster and snort cocaine in middle school. No doubt about that', she says. 'And we can never be certain how long that phase would have lasted, if it wasn't for one little thing. Once that pregnancy test came back positive, there was no more room for drugs and alcohol in our lives. 'We dropped that stuff and didn't even have time to look back.' The teen pregnancy saved their lives from falling further into drug abuse. Now the couple are pursuing healthy, positive lives and hope to encourage teenagers in trouble with self-esteem issues or in unhealthy relationships to seek out counseling to learn self-worth. 'I put my life out there to help others', Catelynn writes. 'For the kids growing up in trailer parks, unstable homes or in the shadow of family problems and addiction – . 'Single moms. 'Pregnant teens feeling lost and scared. 'Anyone trapped in a cycle of dysfunction and wants to make something better of their lives—whatever encouragement we can offer, we offer it from the bottom of our hearts'.

Former White Plains Officer Glen Hochman had filed new retirement papers removing his wife as beneficiary just 10 days before he carried out the killings in Harrison, New York on February 21. It means that the state could recognize the original form - and it has indicated it will do so, the lawyer, Warren Roth, told the newspaper. Scroll down for video . Payout: Glen Hochman, left, removed his wife Anamarie as a beneficiary of his retirement just days before he shot dead two of their daughters and took his own life. But she will likely still receive a payout . 'She would have been left with nothing had this happened two weeks later,' he said. 'They could have decided to accept the other form... but this saves everyone years of litigation. 'We appreciate the state stepping up and helping the family in this critical situation.' White Plains officials have also indicated that the city will cover health insurance for Mrs DiPietro-Hochman, 50, and her surviving 22-year-old daughter, Samantha, for 90 days, Roth said. He added that he hopes they can come to a longer-term agreement over the health insurance. Glen Hochman, 52, retired from the White Plains force after 22 years on January 30. Three weeks later, when his wife and their older daughter were in Connecticut, he gunned down 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna with his 40-caliber Glock as they slept. Murdered: He shot dead 17-year-old Alissa and 13-year-old Deanna (pictured) as well as the family's three dogs before taking his life on February 21. He and his wife had spoken about separating before the deaths . Left behind: His wife, Anamarie DiPietro-Hochman, second left, and their surviving daughter, 22-year-old Samantha, center, are pictured at funerals for the two slain teenagers . He then killed their three dogs, typed out a suicide note on the computer and shot himself. Mrs DiPietro-Hochman asked Alissa's teenage boyfriend to check the house because neither had been able to contact anyone there. He discovered Hochman's body in the garage. He called police who found the girls' bodies. Hochman, who had no known health or psychiatric problems, apparently carried out the killings after he and his wife had spoken about a possible separation weeks earlier. Before the murders, Mrs DiPietro-Hochman went to police to report a non-violent argument with her husband over an $80 cellphone bill because a friend had urged her to record such incidents. Authorities said the suicide note, which was addressed to his wife and which included five or six pages of instructions on getting things in order, indicated that the killings were premeditated. Scene: Alissa's boyfriend found Glen Hochman's body in the garage after Mrs DiPietro-Hochman asked them to check on her family. Police later found the bodies of the girls, who had been shot in their sleep . Interviews with people who knew him found no one had an inkling that 'Mr. Hoffman would have committed this heinous crime,' said Harrison police Chief Anthony Marraccini last week. Still, 'Harrison police investigators discovered a suicide note at the residence indicating that the killings were premeditated by Mr. Hochman,' he said. He added: 'It's difficult, especially when you see two young girls, their lives have been ripped away, brutally murdered. You can't get any rationale for that... The act is so incredibly bad.'",

        "input_text": "Disgraced former CIA chief David Petraeus has agreed to plead guilty to sharing classified information with his mistress, it emerged today. The former U.S. Army General will plead guilty to one felony count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, according to documents filed in Charlotte, North Carolina. The plea deal, which Petraeus signed on February 22, shows the government has agreed to recommend no prison time but will enforce a sentence of two years probation and a $40,000 fine. A judge, who is not bound by the recommendation, will make the final decision. The charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, a $100,000 fine and five years of probation. No immediate date has been set for Petraeus to enter the plea. By striking the deal, he avoids an embarrassing trial that would detail his relationship with Paula Broadwell. He stepped down as head of the CIA after their affair emerged in November 2012. Scroll down for video . Affair: Former CIA chief David Petraeus will plead guilty to a charge of unauthorized removal and retention of classified information after he handed over sensitive material to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, right . Documents filed in federal court state that between August 2011 and April 5, 2013, Petraeus did 'unlawfully and knowingly' take classified materials and retain them at 'unauthorized' locations. Prosecutors say that while Broadwell was writing Petraeus' biography, he gave her binders of the classified materials that included notes about his discussions with President Obama. The binders, known as 'black books,' were seized by the FBI in a search of Petraeus' home. He lied to FBI agents about providing them to Broadwell and said he never gave her classified material, according to court documents. In late August 2011, he took the books to the home where Broadwell was staying during a week-long trip to Washington, D.C., according to the documents. He left the books with her so she could use them as source material for the biography, prosecutors said. Days later, Petraeus brought the books back to his home in Arlington, Virginia. An attorney for Petraeus, Robert Barnett, said he had no immediate comment. Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . Scandal: The affair was revealed after Florida socialite Jill Kelley, pictured, contacted the FBI over threatening emails she had received. It emerged that Broadwell had sent the emails . The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down. In May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the affair. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus was a celebrated general who was credited with helping pull Iraq from the brink of an all-out civil war. President Barack Obama turned to him to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan before moving to him to the CIA in 2011.",

Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki, who works on the boat, has denied these allegations.

Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki told authorities the two did have 'rough sex,' but that is was completely consensual. He also said that the woman seemed to enjoy the encounter.

        "input_text": "A judge on Tuesday ordered jurors in the Jodi Arias case to keep deliberating after her lawyers said the panel had reached an impasse on whether to sentence her to death or life in prison for killing her lover in 2008. Arias, now 34, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim Travis Alexander. That jury deadlocked on her punishment. Authorities said Alexander, 30, was found dead in the shower of his Mesa home after Arias shot him in the forehead and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial. The jury had deliberated about 17 hours over four days. Scroll down for video . Deadlocked: A lawyer for Jodi Arias says jurors at her sentencing retrial are at an impasse over whether to sentence the convicted murderer to life in prison or death for the 2008 killing of her lover. Arias is seen here in court on February 24 . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court. Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors. If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander. Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez (pictured during closing arguments on Feb 24) displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument and called Arias a liar . If the jury reaches deadlock, the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Sherry Stephens (pictured on Feb 24) will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years . Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation. Arias stabbed Alexander nearly 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead in an act she claimed was in self-defense. Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later. Prosecutors said Arias had planned the murder in advance because she was jealous Alexander wanted to break up with her and was planning a trip to Mexico with another woman. Arias claimed Alexander was abusive and obsessed with sex. After she was convicted of murder, Arias said during a jailhouse interview with Fox that she desired the death penalty because it was the 'ultimate freedom'. Arias was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of Alexander in 2008. She claimed she killed him in an act of self-defense, while prosecutors claimed she murdered him in a jealous rage . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . But the trial's jury deadlocked when debating Arias ultimate fate, requiring a second sentencing phase. Arias' new trial began in October and Judge Sherry Stephens banned news organizations from live broadcasting the case. She ruled that court proceedings could only be aired after the verdict, which  can be aired live. In November, Arias pleaded for her life in front of the jury. The judge allowed her to testify in secret and sealed the testimony to the public, but transcripts were released after news organizations complained and an appeals court threw out the decision. If Arias receives the death penalty she will be only the third woman on death row in Arizona. The new jury of eight woman and four men left for the day on Wednesday without having reached a decision. If they reach deadlock the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Stephens will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.",

The social media craze, known as #tighthairdo, was inspired by schoolgirl Jordyn Miller who found a creative way to cope with bullies after she was teased for losing her her hair due to chemotherapy. As people became aware of little girl's experience, they have posted photos on social media with stocking on their heads just like Jordyn did in a sign of solidarity, accompanied by a hashtag declaring 'Jordyn is beautiful'. TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan and presenter Jessica Rowe are just some of the people that have ptaken part to raise money to help children recovering from cancer battles. Scroll down for video . Jordyn Miller (left) was diagnosed with stage one cancer when she was five. She and her sister Charli (right) would wear tights and tea-towels on their heads to help Jordyn cope with losing her beloved hair . Big Brother winner Tim Dormer posed with tights on his head to support little Jordyn and encourage people to donate to help children with cancer . Celebrity chef Manu Feildel and TV presenter Jessica Rowe also joined in to help Jordyn and Camp Quality . On her first day of school, the six-year-old refused to remove her hat and was bullied for 'looking like a boy' At just five-years-old Jordyn was diagnosed with 'Wilm's tumor', a cancer of the kidneys. After five months of chemotherapy and a long recovery from surgery, the kindergarten student was so nervous to return to school that she refused to remove her hat. The little girl from Wingham on the north coast of New South Wales, was upset after losing her long, wavy hair. 'She used to have beautiful, long curly hair that she used to love – she's a very girly girl and the chemo caused it to fall out which was a big deal for Jordyn,' Her mother Tarin Miller,33, told Daily Mail Australia. Unfortunately, her fear that the other kids would make fun of her was not unfounded. 'When she first started school, she was shy about it and kids being kids used to tease her about looking like a boy. They'd call her ugly.' One of her daughter's coping mechanisms was to wear a pair of tights or a tea-towel on her head. 'One day Jordan just come out of her room with the tights on her head and said 'this is my beautiful long hair' and Charli, being her little sister, just copied,' she said. Newsreader Mark Ferguson and Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan also posed with tights on their head . Members of the Sydney Kings basketball team posed in colourful stockings to help kids with cancer . The kindergarten student had her left kidney removed after she was found to have a Wilms tumour . The sibling would spend entire days with tea towels or tights on their heads, even enlisting their cousin whenever she would visit. Camp Quality posted the pictures on their Facebook page. The beautiful images of Charli and Jordyn grinning with their stocking hair were shared widely. Touched by the image of sisterly support, people chose to join in by posting images of themselves with tights on their head with #tighthairdo and #jordynisbeautiful. Camp Quality decided to use the opportunity to start a social media campaign, inspired by the success of the 2014 craze, the Ice Bucket Challenge. The challenge raised money for ALS by asking people to throw icy buckets of water on their heads, donate money to the cause and nominate friends to do the same. Jordyn, pictured with her parents Tarin and Anthony (left), also underwent five months of chemotherapy in which she lost all her hair . TV chef Miguel Maestre also wanted people to wear tights and nominate people to help raise money for puppet shows which help make school children aware of how to be kind and considerate of children returning to school after cancer treatment . Camp Quality set up a text donation platform, so people could donate to nominate the next friends they wanted to see post a #tighthairdo. Celebrities who have already gotten behind the campaign and posted a #tighthairdo include TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmers Eamon Sullivan and Alicia Coutts and former Vogue Editor Kirstie Clements. News presenter Mark Ferguson, TV presenter Jessica Rowe and Sydney Kings basketball players have also shown their support for Jordyn and all children undergoing cancer treatment. Jana Cooper, Camp Quality's Marketing Manager, said: 'The point of difference between this campaign and the Ice Bucket Challenge or the #nomakeupselfie, is that the whole idea centres around kids.' 'It was created by kids, it raises money for kids and we've seen many kids get involved. Something else that makes it unique is that it was born in Australia and it uses an Australian text donation service. To be involved, people simply need to text 'Jordyn' to 0476 000 222 to donate. Camp Quality has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support  their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer . All funds donated to the campaign will help fund Camp Quality’s touring puppet show for schools. These shows teach pupils how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer. The performance is incredibly effective in preventing and tackling teasing, staring and name-calling when a child returns to school post-treatment. A urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in Jordyn's left kidney. She was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ. According to Gary Nunn from the cancer charity Camp Quality, Jordyn is one of 10,000 children across Australia who are currently newly diagnosed, under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment. The show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer, including that it is contagious, encouraging them to support and include kids with . Mr Nunn told Daily Mail Australia that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment, just as things are starting to look up, one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying. 'We've heard about everything from pointing and staring and: 'mummy, why does she looks so different?' to exclusion and isolation,' Mr Nunn said. 'Exclusion is one of the more common ones, kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it's contagious. 'We hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called 'baldie' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it'. Camp Quality is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment, while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer. The charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers, to expel the myths around cancer. Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for the cancer charity, said that by the end of the show ,the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat . Former Vogue editor Kirstie Clements posted a photo on Twitter encouraging people to take part in the Camp Quality campaign . Their show has been viewed by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running. It involves a bald cancer-patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat - just like little Jordyn. 'By the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat,' Mr Nunn explains. 'Once our puppet show had come to one school, we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she didn't wear it from then on. Once we teach the students about it, that child becomes a sort of hero for all they've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend.' After Mrs Miller asked Camp Quality to come to her daughter's school to perform their puppet show, she said there was an instant change in attitude. Now, whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was, Jordyn - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she's looking forward to having long hair again.",

The comments were made during an interview on the CNN program New Day when host Chris Cuomo asked the retired doctor if he did in fact believe that being gay was a choice. Carson followed up his comment by implying that something happens to incarcerated individuals while behind bars that makes them choose to be gay. 'So did something happen while they were in there?' he said. 'Ask yourself that question.' He then went in on the issue of gay marriage. 'Why do gay people want to get married? Why do they say they want to get married? Because they want to have various rights -- property rights, visitation rights,' he said. 'Why can't any two human beings, I don't care what their sexual orientation is, why can't they have the legal right to do those things? That does not require changing the definition of marriage.' For this reason he said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level, this on the same day the Alabama Supreme Court ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples. Carson is in favor of civil unions. Carson has long been outspoken when it comes to his opinions on gay marriage, which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech. In an interview with Sean Hannity, Carson said; 'My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman. It's a well-established, fundamental pillar of society and no group, be they gays, be they NAMBLA, be they people who believe in bestiality. It doesn't matter what they are.' He continued by saying; 'They don't get to change the definition. So he, it's not something that is against gays, it's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society. It has significant ramifications.' The comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point Carson has come across as an affable and moderate Republican in a series of interviews. The backlash was so strong, especially among young Americans, that Carson was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater Johns Hopkins. Earlier this week Carson launched an exploratory committee to run for president, becoming the first high-profile Republican candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race.",

Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave Scientology in 2007 after almost taking his own life, and has now been forced to live on the run. 'It's psychological warfare and after a while it gets to you,' he said of being a member of the polarizing religion. 'Things got so bad that I tried to jump off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2007, trying to kill myself.' He spent 28 days in a mental institution following this incident, and that is when he finally left the church. Scroll down for video . The nephew of John Travolta (above with wife Kelly Preston) has come forward in a new interview to describe his decision to leave the Church of Scientology . Sam Travolta Jr. says he decided to leave the Church of Scientology (above) after he tried to take his own life, at which point members began mouthing to hi, 'You are dead' Speaking with The National Enquirer, Sam did however say that his famous uncle did everything he could to help him, but even he could not stop the attacks that were waged against him after his decision to leave. 'Planting drugs on me' and 'spreading rumors around town that I was psychotic, and even worse - a pedophile,' are just two of the ways Sam claims members of the church tried to bring him down after his decision to leave Scientology. ''My uncle told me, \"Sorry, Sam, I can't help you. They don't care who I am.\"' His uncle does however supply Sam with a monthly allowance, which is greatly appreciated by the struggling screenwriter. Sam also says in the interview that Travolta has never pressured members of his family into joining Scientology, though he does say he would be 'friendlier' to those individuals who were members of the church. The other claim Sam makes against the church, and one that has been brought up frequently by former members, is the amount of work required of members for little to no pay. Sam claims he worked as a file clerk, 'making $36 for a 60-hour week.' Then, there was the treatment he received from other members shortly before he left the church. Sam, claims they 'would mouth to me, \"You are dead,\" over and over again. It was all about mental control for them.' The 47-year-old says he has moved on now that the attacks have stopped, and he is finally trying to get his life back on track. Sam's interview meanwhile could not come at a worse time for the church, with the HBO documentary Going Clear set to premiere later this month. The film takes a look at the religion, and how its treatment of A-list members like Tom Cruise and Travolta, differs from others in the church. It is based on the book of the same name, which was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2013, and is based on interviews conducted with over 200 members of the religion who decided to leave the church. John Travolta's lawyer has denied the claims made by his nephew in this interview.",

        "input_text": "A controversial documentary, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, claims the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. On Monday makers of the film Going Clear: Scientology And The Prison Of Belief sat down for a panel discussion, where they addressed the alleged role the church played in the demise of the Hollywood couple's marriage. Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times, between author Lawrence Wright (who wrote the book the film is based on), filmmaker Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder. Scroll down for video... Revelations: A documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival alleges that the Church of Scientology broke up Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman . In the film Marty Rathbun, formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims he had been appointed to 'facilitate the breakup' because the head of the church, David Miscavige, was suspicious of Cruise's second wife. Monday's panel discussion focused in on Rathbun's claims. 'David Miscavige [leader of the Church of Scientology] was terrified that he was losing control of Tom Cruise, because Tom Cruise is the greatest rainmaker really, for Scientology,' Gibney claimed. Panel discussion: Logan Hill moderated the talk, held by The New York Times , author Lawrence Wright, director Paul Haggis, director Alex Gibney and former Scientology member Mike Rinder on Monday . At odds: Filmmakers say church leaders were fearful of Nicole's influence on Tom, pictured in Los Angeles in 1991 . The director went on to assert that Scientology and psychiatry are opposed, adding that the actress' father 'was a psychologist in Australia.' 'Miscavige was afraid that Nicole Kidman was slowly taking Tom away from the church,' Gibney continued. 'There was a concerted effort to get him back. One of the things they did was... at Tom's behest, Marty Rathbun testifies in the film, that David Miscavige requested Marty to go and tap Nicole Kidman's phone.' Cruise's attorney, however, told E! News regarding the claims of wiretapping: 'Tom Cruise did not hire any private investigator to spy on or investigate Nicole Kidman in any way. Nor did he ask the Church of Scientology to do that. Any statement to the contrary is provably false.' Gibney's film claims that Kidman, who was raised Catholic, convinced Cruise to distance himself from the Church of Scientology between 1992 and 2001. Over: The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church's Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004, pictured in 1999 . It also alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding. Rathbun suggests, in the film, this is when the aggressive campaign to tear the couple apart began. Urging them: Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Wright publicly pressed John Travolta and Cruise to speak out about claims of abuse within the church . Gibney went on to claim during Monday's panel: 'The other, more pernicious thing that happened was that they tried to turn their two kids against Nicole, which is really the most horrifying thing. 'They succeeded, so much so that we have people who told us that they began to refer to their mother privately as a suppressive person... and then they were told, \"Now listen, the way you deal with suppressive people is, don't let on to them that you know that they're a suppressive person. So, be nice, smile, but be aware that this person is more dangerous and damaging than anything you could possibly believe.\"' Rinder, a former high ranking member of the church, went on to offer his own views on the claims: 'The circumstances surrounding that and his description of what happened, rings so true. 'The mind-set of Nicole isn't really with the program so here we go back to disconnection again, except it's got a nicer name, it doesn't exactly get presented that way to Tom Cruise.' 'It's \"Tom, she's not good for you, you better straighten out here and get your life in order and we'll help you,\"' he continued. 'That dictatorial control and efforts to control people's lives is really the ebb and flow of the Church of Scientology... There are all sorts of examples like that.' Back in 2012 Maureen Orth wrote a piece making similar claims about Kidman and Cruise's children being turned against the actress. At the time the church denied the claims made by the Vanity Fair piece. Cruise and Kidman share two adopted children together, Isabella, 22, and Conor, 20. Meanwhile, during Monday's panel Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Wright publicly pressed John Travolta and Cruise to speak out about claims of abuse within the church. 'The reason we are calling out Cruise and Travolta is they have the capacity, the power, to change it. There are only two ways that you can address the abuses that are going on in Scientology,' Wright said. Allegations: Marty Rathbun (left), formerly the second highest-ranking official, claims the head of the church David Miscavige (right) was suspicious of Cruise's second wife . Concerns: Kidman (pictured with Cruise in 2001) was listed as a 'Potential Trouble Source' because her father was a psychologist in Australia . 'One is to re-examine the tax exemption. But some of those celebrity megaphones, if they were turned around in the other direction they could make a difference. They should make a difference. I'd like to see Tom Cruise stand up and say it's time for David Miscavige to answer his accusers.' The Church Of Scientology responded belatedly to DailyMail.com's request for comment and denied all allegations made by the film and the filmmakers, including allegations of wiretapping, and claims made about David Miscavige. The church also characterized Marty Rathbun, Mike Rinder, and Alex Gibney as biased and unreliable sources. Before the controversial documentary's first screening, HBO hired 160 lawyers to look through the film. It is expected to air on the channel on March 29. In more than 200 tweets, the church has tried to discredit Gibney and his sources in Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival last month. It has also issued a statement on the website of Freedom Magazine, its news publication, claiming the documentary is 'propaganda', 'one-sided', full of 'false information' and features 'vengeful' sources. Anger: The film alleges that during the filming of Stanley Kubrick's, Cruise wasn't returning Miscavige's (pictured) phone calls, even though he was the best man at the actor's wedding . Friends: Cruise, left, embraces David Miscavige, the Scienology Church's President of the Rulling Council during the official opening of a new Scientology church in central Madrid in 2004 . And a week before the premiere, it took out full-page ads in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times to offer a counter point of view. In addition, the church released a statement to Us Weekly, stating: 'This is not a film that is any way objective about Scientology. It is propaganda... Freedom of the press is not freedom to lie. The Church of Scientology has long fought against the kind of bigotry and religious hatred that Mr. Gibney and co-producer Lawrence Wright aim to incite. To fit their anti-religious agenda, they scraped the bottom of the barrel to cherry-pick a tiny collection of deadbeats.' Despite the furor surrounding the production, Gibney hopes it will lead to more investigations and reports into Scientology. He told Variety magazine: 'We hope that this film and Larry's book will start the process where more media will say well we don't care anymore. We're going to pursue this no matter what. According to the credits at the end of the film, Cruise and Kidman refused to be interviewed. The pair divorced in 2001 and following the split, Cruise became more active in the Church of Scientology, receiving the church's Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004.",

        "input_text": "An horrifically burned 12-year-old boy was able to tell police it was his dad who started the fatal house fire that killed him and his nine-year-old brother, an inquest has heard. Salesman Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Paul, 9, and his brother Jack, 12, to the attic with fun-size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital. Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns: 'It was my dad that started the fire' and 'My dad did it on purpose.' The fire, which was started deliberately by Mr Sykes (centre), killed himself along with his nine-year-old son Paul (left) and Jack (right), 12 . Jack (right) and Paul Sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze. Here the two boys are pictured with their mother Claire Throssell . Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries told the boys' tearful mother Claire Throssell: 'Your loss has deeply affected me.' He said she bore no blame for the tragedy and told her: 'You have nothing to blame yourself about.' The inquest heard Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives'. Investigating officer Detective Sargent Stuart Hall said: 'I believe the children were almost lured into the loft by the newly purchased train track and fun-size chocolate bars which had been left there to maintain their attentions.' The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with CAFCASS - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy. He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights. Mr Sykes told his boss Andre Spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the CAFCASS visit was a 'waste of time' and 'they wanted to talk about negatives and didn't want to listen to his agenda'. Mr Spencer said: 'He was a dedicated father. His children were his number one priority. He talked about them to the point that he seemed obsessed and boring.' An inquest into the death of Paul (pictured bottom left and far right) and Jack was carried out today, where a coroner ruled their deaths were the result of an unlawful killing . Claire Throssell's son Jack clung to life in intensive care with his mother (pictured) at his bedside, but died five days later . He felt the access arrangements were 'barbaric' and he mistakenly believed Paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week. 'There's no point living,' he told his boss. Mr Spencer said he then went on: 'If anything did happen would I care for his boys.' CAFCASS family adviser Rona Murphy told the inquest in her dealings with the family Paul did want to see his father but only for a three-hour visit on one day a week. Paul had told her about 'issues of abuse' and described meal times as a 'battleground' because his dad 'wanted him to eat more and everything and he didn't want to.' She did not believe Mr Sykes was taking on board what she was telling him. 'He was saying how can I have any less contact than I already have.' Council social worker Julie Keen said four months before the tragedy she had a referral that Paul didn't want to go home from school and have contact with his father. The boys' heartbroken mother Claire Throssell (pictured at her sons' funeral) told the inquest her two children had 'meant the world' to her . 'Paul said his dad was abusive to him and Jack,' she said. 'It was general physical and emotional abuse. On a skiing trip Paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat.' When Mr Sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife. Mr Sykes, lived in Penistone, South Yorkshire, after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's in nearby Thurlstone. On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account. He spent £600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'. Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, some petrol and posted letters to family and friends and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home. He picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire. The inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him. He took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms. Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him. When the fire crew arrived it appeared Jack had bravely tried to get out of the loft as he was found by the bottom of the ladder. Mourners stand by as the caskets of Jack and Paul are carried from a church during their funeral in October . Mr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'. A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze. Cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs. One of his letters to HSBC Bank said: 'I won't be paying the mortgage any more because I won't be alive.' Det Sgt Hall said numerous statements taken by the police showed he was at a 'particularly low point' in his life over visiting rights to his sons and took the view he would have less access. Specialist fire investigator Michael Mason said the carpet and furniture downstairs were well alight when firefighters arrived. 'The door to the stairs had been wedged to stop anyone coming down and there were chairs behind the front door as if to prevent people coming in,' he said. Two bodies were found in the loft - that of Mr Sykes and his son Paul - and Mr Sykes was declared dead on arrival at hospital. Pictured is the home where Paul Skyes killed his two sons after trapping them in the attic and starting a fire . Petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames. Mr Mason said: 'At some point during the fire the loft hatch was closed and then opened during the fire which allowed a plume of smoke with gases to enter the loft. It was a natural reaction to try and get out.' It emerged that it was Jack who opened the hatch and he was rescued conscious by firefighters but died five days later in hospital from his burns. Mr Sykes and Paul died from inhaling noxious fumes. In her statement, the boys' mother said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.' When asked by the coroner if there was anything she would like to add, she replied: 'There is nothing further I can add other than the guilt I that I carry for what has happened to them.' The coroner recorded a verdict on Monday that Mr Sykes committed suicide. Yesterday the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing. Coroner Dorries said: 'This fire was set deliberately indeed the whole event was carefully planned by Mr Sykes to ensure a catastrophic fire while the boys were distracted by model railway equipment and sweets.'",

Just weeks after the live-baiting scandal rocked the dog racing industry - when the use of live pigs, possums and rabbits to train greyhounds and boost their aggression was exposed - a horrific and often unsanctioned international trade can also be revealed by Daily Mail Australia. The dogs, both young animals and those at the end of their racing lives, are shipped mostly to Macau, Hong Kong, Argentina and Chile where they are housed in appalling conditions. Scroll down for videos . Australian greyhounds in South America and Asia are fed a cocktail of drugs before being 'run to their death' according to animal welfare groups. This one-time Australian competitor died immediately after a race . Bloodsport. The horrid outcome of a match race in Argentina after two dogs pursue the lure to the end. Animal rights groups in South America say they often descend into a fight to the death . The Canidrome in Macau where many Australian dogs compete. Animals Australia says 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and ... every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years' Although there are legal, strictly policed races, at the end of unofficial events the blood-thirsty animals often maul each other to death. If an animal finishes outside the top three in five consecutive races they are euthanised or dumped by the side of the road, where they starve to death. Argentina-based animal rights group Proyecto Galgo says that Australia and American dogs are particularly sought after in South America because of their superior pedigree. Animal protection groups have called for immediate government intervention, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers after the live-baiting scandal was exposed will lead to an increase in the black market trade to these gambling-loving countries. Australian dogs, along with those from the US and Ireland, are considered among the best in the world for both racing and breeding purposes, and are exported to countries which struggle to produce quality runners. In something akin to the barbaric scenes at cock-fighting rings or dog fights, activists say that at some tracks the greyhounds race in pairs down a straight, with frenzied punters packed either side, and the animals often maul each other at the end of a sprint. Animal protection groups in Argentina have joined the call for Australia's Federal Government to intervene, fearing that the crackdown on local trainers because of the live-baiting scandal, will lead to the 'black market' trade of Australian greyhounds gathering even more pace . Killing fields. These stomach churning images are published by animal protection groups as proof of the horrific lack of control over the fate of greyhounds in Asia . Freedom of Information documents obtained by Animals Australia from the Department of Agriculture and seen by Daily Mail Australia show only 20 dogs were officially registered as arriving from Australia in Argentina in the past two years. It's widely suspected that hundreds more have been exported through back channels. There is no information about the fates of these animals. 'Greyhounds here, including those from Australia, suffer a terrible fate,' claims an activist from Proyecto Galgos, who gave her name only as Ines. 'Here the situation is this; they use the galgos (greyhounds) in an exhaustive way. In one day, they can race in many places sometimes (and) are drugged with arsenic, cocaine, Viagra and methamphetamines. 'Sometimes they give them the drugs directly in their chest in the racing facilities. 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs.' Some, she said, are saved for breeding but even then they are plied with reproductive drugs. 'That is the best scenario, but if they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads or left to die of starvation and in some cases they are killed.' 'Many times they die in the racing facility. A racing galgo doesn't run more than one or two championships because of the drugs' say animal rights groups in Argentina, who provided this image to show the level of neglect for a one-time racing dog . If they are no good at running, they are discharged on roads, or left to die of starvation, and in some cases they are killed' according to Proyecto Galgos from Argentina . With punting, legal and otherwise, a major past-time in parts of Argentina and Chile, exposing those who trade in the barbarism comes at a cost for groups like Proyecto Galgos, with members subjected to death threats on a regular basis. 'Here (in South America) they are used as merchandise, they are objects and when they aren't useful anymore they get rid of them,' Ines said. 'Sometimes they are sold and other times they change them for a chair or a television or anything.' Races are prohibited in two Argentinian regions, including the capital Buenos Aires and in Santa Fe. Cordoba is debating whether to shut down the industry too. While it is clear that many have previously been sent using official channels, through the control of authorities via a 'greyhound passport', there has been a crackdown on that process by governing bodies like Greyhounds Australasia. The exports, however, continue unabated. Lobbyists say just how so many end up in countries like Argentina and Korea (which is not on the official list) remains a mystery. Greyhounds Australasia CEO Scott Parker admitted that GA has no control of the greyhound export industry. ‘We have absolutely no idea of what dogs had gone where in the past six months because we are totally out of the loop,' he said. ‘It’s because of the lack of regulations, something we have stressed to the (Agriculture) Minister and hoped we’d get a meeting with him to discuss it but that hasn't eventuated as yet but we are still trying. Greyhound data shows some of Australia's best known runners have been sent through the correct channels over the years to spend their time in the breeding kennels in places like South America. Animal activists want tighter controls on exports by the Federal Government to ensure the future of all greyhounds . Lobbyists say not all dogs face the same fate, however, pointing to several examples over the years of top Australian greyhounds like this one being cared for in the correct manner by respected Argentinian studs . ‘The passport has no government regulatory standing but at least that enabled us to make sure they (greyhound owners) were doing the right thing . ‘Exporting Australian greyhounds without a GA issued passport is against the rules but some might take the risk knowing that government allows their export as long as the dogs are fit and well. ‘They enter into private arrangements and when someone says 100 have gone over in the past month, it’s out of our hands – a member of the public with no connection to the governing body can send them to anywhere in the world, if they want.’ He's also called on the Federal Government to put strong legislation behind 'the rules' of greyhound exports. There are examples of successful transitions; including star performers Bogie Ace and The Chief, who had top careers on the track in Australia and went on to have rewarding stud lives and were treated humanely. They, however, are rare examples. Up until now, authorities have been scrambling to keep on top of the shipping of Australian greyhounds to Asia, particularly Macau, for competition at the Yat Yuen Canidrome, but now revelations they are appearing with greater frequency in South America, has activists concerned. 'I think what’s clear is that the welfare of greyhounds is not a priority, these dogs come a distant second to profits on offer in this industry,' Lisa Chalk from Animals Australia said. 'In Australia, thousands of healthy dogs are killed simply because they don’t run fast enough and hundreds are exported overseas each year to countries that have no laws to protect them from cruelty. 'The country of greatest concern currently is Macau where dogs are raced at a facility called the Canidrome. 'They are kept in small cages when not racing and are killed if they fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races. 'Dogs sent to Macau from Australia are dead within three years. Greyhound racing in Macau is built around the supply of dogs from Australia which makes the situation all the more outrageous.' Advocates also warn that, many of the export countries (in Asia), are known for their huge illegal trade in dog meat for human consumption. 'Macau offers no re-homing program for retired greyhounds and the head of the Macau government’s animal control department has stated that every dog imported to the country from Australia is dead within around three years,' Ms Chalk added. 'Greyhounds Australasia has stopped issuing passports to allow greyhounds to be sent for racing but that hasn't stopped the export. 'It's time for the Australian Government to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether.' Animal advocates have called on the Australian Government 'to take a stand and ban the export of greyhounds altogether' to provide more protection for the animals. This is an example of a neglected pup in Argentina . The live-baiting scandal has led to more than 70 Australian trainers being implicated. Five Queensland greyhound trainers have already been banned for life . Animals Australia claim that 'greyhounds from Australia were killed at the Canidrome at a rate of more than one every day'. 'Nearly all of these dogs were healthy and not even five years old. All they had done wrong is fail to finish in the top three for five consecutive races,' Ms Chalk said. 'With an ongoing supply of dogs from Australia, this unethical practice can continue, and is even threatening to expand.' Macau is the only place in China where greyhound racing is currently legal but that could soon be expanded. Her South American colleagues agree: 'The shortage of quality animals (in South America) means the exporting to places such as Argentina from Australia can be a profitable business.'

        "input_text": "A man convicted of killing the father and sister of his former girlfriend in a fiery attack on the family's Southern California home was sentenced to death on Tuesday. Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced for the murders of Jay Dhanak, 56, and his daughter Karishma, 20, in May 2007, the Orange County district attorney's office said. Murtaza was convicted in December 2013 of killing the pair in an attempt to reunite with his then-18-year-old ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. She had ended their relationship citing her Hindu family's opposition to her dating a Muslim. To be executed: Iftekhar Murtaza, 30, was sentenced to death Tuesday for the May 21, 2007 murders of his ex-girlfriend's father and sister and the attempted murder of her mother . Authorities said Murtaza and a friend torched the family's Anaheim Hills home and kidnapped and killed Dhanak's father and sister, leaving their stabbed bodies burning in a park 2 miles from Dhanak's dorm room at the University of California, Irvine. Dhanak's mother, Leela, survived the attack. She was stabbed and left unconscious on a neighbor's lawn. Murtaza was interviewed by police several days later and arrested at a Phoenix airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 in cash. Jurors recommended that Murtaza be sentenced to death for the crimes. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home after they broke-up, believing the murders of her family would reunited them . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Two of his friends were also sentenced to life in prison for the murders, but one of them, Vitaliy Krasnoperov, recently had his conviction overturned on appeal. Authorities said Krasnoperov hatched the plot to kill the Dhanaks with Murtaza and tried to help him hire a hit man. They said another friend, Charles Murphy Jr., helped Murtaza carry out the killings after Dhanak said she planned to go on a date with someone else. During the trial, Murtaza testified that he told many people he wanted to kill the Dhanaks because he was distraught over the breakup, but he said he didn't mean it literally. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight .",

        "input_text": "A Fort Worth, Texas elementary school has come under fire from parents who claim certain teachers and administrators have cultivated a 'toxic' environment for their children. At a Monday board meeting, parents turned out to support Kourtney Glaser, the former vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in the Eagle Mountain-Saginaw Independent School District, who was placed on administrative leave after she experienced heavy vaginal bleeding that the school claims was caused by 'severe anxiety.' Glaser, 31, and her doctors, have firmly stated the bleeding, which occurred during a district training session and required Glaser to seek immediate medical attention, was the result of an intrauterine device being lodged in her uterine wall. This was just the beginning of the parents complaints as well, as they also voiced their concern over 'staff drinking,' the 'use of disparaging nicknames for teachers, parents and even children,' and a principal who has been reassigned after her 'bullying tactics.' Scroll down for video . Kourtney Glaser (above), the vice principal at Comanche Springs Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas was placed on leave because she had vaginal bleeding . Once parents got wind of this news, many rallied behind Glasser, and seemed to place most of the blame on the principal, Katy Maurer (above in leopard print top) According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Glaser was forced to go to the emergency room on January 28 when she began suddenly bleeding, and two days later had her device removed to stop the trauma. She was not allowed to return to work however, and instead placed on leave after receiving a letter shortly after that said her bleeding had occurred on multiple occasions and was the result of 'severe anxiety.' On top of this, she was told she would need to see two doctors and sign a waiver releasing her medical records before she would be allowed to return to work. The letter also claimed she had trouble speaking in front of large groups, something Glasser denied in an interview with ABC 8. At this point, some parents at the school became aware of the situation, and seemed to place the blame on Katy Maurer, the principal of the school. The situation then became even further complicated when just last week Maurer filed a police report claiming she was being harassed by an employee at the school and her husband. The name of the employee was not released, but it was revealed to be someone who was on leave. In her report, Maurer claimed this employee had posted 'very hateful things' about her on social media, and that these posts had led to national attention. The employee also reportedly referred to Maurer as an 'idiot,' while the employee's husband is accused in the report of stalking Maurer, coming to the school unannounced, following her to restaurants, and showing up at her home. Maurer, 34,said this has been going on for close to five weeks. The district said it is examining the claims, while a lawyer for Glaser, Brittany Lannen, all but admitted she was the woman named in the report, saying; '“Once the aggressor is caught, they attempt to play the victim. Thankfully with today’s technology and social media, Ms. Maurer’s false accusations can easily be dismissed with a quick view of Mrs. Glaser’s social media.' She also added that Glaser's husband was not ever told he could not be on school grounds. Maurer, meanwhile, has been reassigned to another school in the district. 'It was a very sad situation,' said retired teacher Carol Smith. “ . Smith then said of Maurer; 'She was hired against the recommendation of the committee, and I felt like I was working with a person in the seventh grade.' Parents brought up Glaser's situation at a meeting Monday (above), along with staff drinking on campus and the use of disparaging nicknames for students . The district said it is investigating the leadership and these incidents at the school (above) PTA member Jennifer Jordan said that Maurer tries to exercise too much control over how decisions are made at the school, claiming she 'has tried to remove PTA leaders, and has said she only wants people she likes on the board.' There were also claims at Monday's meeting that Maurer had 'misused PTA travel funds for personal entertainment.' 'My daughter is stuck in a horrible situation at Comanche Springs,' said Chad Ferguson. 'I want my kids to grow up and feel like when something is not right, they have an obligation to try and make it right without fear of retribution.' In a statement released last Friday, the district said; 'The administration of Eagle Mountain-Saginaw ISD is very aware of the concerns surrounding the leadership team at Comanche Springs Elementary, and is actively working toward a resolution.'",

        "input_text": "A reporter for Fox 5 in Washington D.C. has come under fire for telling very different versions of a home invasion story that she has repeated while advocating gun ownership. Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for WTTG-TV, has previously claimed she fell victim to a terrifying home invasion on New Year's Day in 2010 while dog-sitting for friends at their house. In one interview for the National Rifle Association, she said she returned to the home to find it being robbed before trying to take a photo of the suspect - and being chased by a group of 15 men. But a police report has now revealed a very different - and far less harrowing - tale than the one she has shared publicly. Scroll down for video . Changing story: Emily Miller, the chief investigative reporter for Fox 5, has repeatedly told a story in which she was the victim of a home invasion, but now a police report has revealed discrepancies in the accounts . The Washington Post's Erik Wemple unearthed a supplemental police report in which she told police she left the home for 10 minutes to walk the dog and when she returned, she saw a man walking out from behind a fence. She asked him why he was there and he told her he was delivering firewood, the police report noted, and left. Miller, who had forgotten to lock the door behind her when she took out the dog, went into the house and 'felt that something was not right', according to the report, so left to take a photo of his car. Outside, the suspect gave her a business card showing a tree service company before leaving, and Miller saw that he was driving a silver truck showing the name of a landscaping company. But later that evening, her credit card company called her about fraudulent activity on her card and she checked her wallet and saw the card and $50 were missing, according to the report. She had left the wallet out on a table inside the unlocked home while walking the dog. The police report shows that after she told police about the fraudulent activity on her card, they tracked down the purchases to a Wal-Mart and a tattoo shop. Harrowing: In one retelling of the story, for a 2014 video for the National Rifle Association (pictured), Miller said she returned to find the home being robbed and the man took off with her wallet . Terrifying: A reenactment of the crime in the NRA video shows it happened at night, rather than at 3pm . But when police tried to contact her to take the case further, she did not return messages they left on her phone on three separate occasions and the report was suspended. The tale is far more dramatic when she re-tells it. In one example, she recounted the story on a video for the NRA. A reenactment of the robbery in the video shows the robbery unfolding at night, rather than at 3pm as shown in the police report. Tale: In her book, Miller says she attempted to take the man's photo in the street but he stopped her . 'A man - the police believed to be a drug addict - got into the house and started robbing it,' she said on the video. 'So when I came back into the house he was in there robbing. 'He took my wallet but I was able to talk him out of the house without hurting me, thank God.' She claims she then decided to follow him to get a picture - 'which was really stupid' - and came across 15 men standing around two pickup trucks in the street. When they saw her, they started running towards her and she fled back to the house, where she called the police, she said. 'Going to bed that night in this house, it was the first time in my life I thought \"I just wish I had a gun by my night table then I can defend myself if those men come in\",' she said. Miller has also said she was a 'victim of a home invasion' on other occasions, including in speeches. And in a series for the Washington Times, 'Emily Gets Her Gun', she said the man told her he had come to service the swimming pool before leaving. She followed him with her phone. 'I walked down the street, and as I turned the corner, I saw about 15 scruffy young men standing around two pickup trucks,' she wrote. When she held up her phone to take a photo, a man blocked her shot and demanded to know what she was doing. '\"Nothing, I'm um, just going now,\" I said as I put my Blackberry down instead of taking the picture around him and went home,' she wrote - not mentioning a chase. She later turned her Washington Times series into a book, 'Emily Gets Her Gun... But Obama Wants to Take Yours', which was published in September 2013. Advocate: She has shared the story while advocating for gun rights in Washington DC. In a recent series on Fox5, she charted her attempts to get a gun in the state . According to Wemple of the Washington Post, the discrepancies in her story are important because she 'has hitched her career' on it. She has cited the incident as a driving force behind her wish to get a gun in Washington D.C., and has charted her attempt in a series on Fox5. In a report on Fox5 last week, she revealed that she had been approved for the gun permit after providing the state two police reports showing threats on her life, she said. In another questionable move, she has been described as a pro-gun advocate while still working as a journalist. Fox identified her as 'a proponent of Second Amendment rights' when it published her recent stories. When reached by DailyMail.com for comment, Miller, 44, directed requests to Fox's public relations team, who have yet to respond. Before working for Fox 5, she worked for The Washington Times, AOL's Politics Daily and ABC News, according to her online bio.",

Sami, who did not wish to give his last name, had been exchanging text messages with the convicted drug smuggler up until late Tuesday night before the Australian was transferred to Nusakambangan in Central Java from Bali's Kerobokan prison. The friend, who has known Chan since they met in Year 7 at Homebush Boys High in Sydney's west, told 9News the Bali Nine ringleader was calm when they spoke through text messaging application, Whatsapp. Scroll down for video . Fellow Bali Nine member Andrew Chan was also onboard the chartered flight to Cilacap . Myuran Sukuraman arrives in Cilacap - the closest port to Nusakambangan - on Wednesday morning local time . A school friend of Chan's (left), who went to Homebush Boys High with him (Chan pictured right as a student), told 9News the Australian had been calm and stayed positive up until yesterday about his impending execution . Sami and Chan had been exchanging text messages on Whatsapp (pictured) up until Tuesday night . 'Even he thought it was never going to happen because he thought we're in the limelight - it'll cool down, it'll be alright,' Sami said. 'So I always said, \"yeah mate, definitely - you're in good hands\".' At least once during their exchange, Chan text him 'all good bro'. Sami added Chan kept positive throughout the ordeal and said: 'I think he [Chan] was really expecting the Australian government to do a lot more.' It comes as it is revealed Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop made a desperate plea to Jakarta officials to swap Chan and fellow Bali Nine member Myuran Sukuraman for three Indonesian drug offenders being held in Australia. Ms Bishop proposed the deal in a 'very tense' phone call with Indonesian foreign affairs minister Retno Marsudi, The Australian reported. Earlier this week, Indonesia's human rights commissioner Natalius Pigai (centre) with Sukuraman (left) and Chan (right) It has been revealed Foreign Affair Minister Julie Bishop bargained to have the duo's lives spared in exchange for three Indonesian drug smugglers who were caught with 252 kilograms of heroin in Australia . The pair were taken onto a ship from Cilacap port to Nusakambangan port in armoured car . The port was heavily guarded as Chan and Sukuraman made their way from Cilacap airport on Wednesday morning in Central Java . This is their final journey to Nusakambangan before they will be executed by firing squad . It is tipped they will be killed this weekend and will be given 72 hours notice before it happens . Indonesia has allocated around $20,000 for each prisoner in its 'execution budget' to kill the Australians . The call became so intense that it was feared Ms Marsudi would put a sudden end to the conversation. The prisoners up for negotiation were three Indonesians caught smuggling 252 kilograms of heroin into Australia by sea in 2000. Kristito Mandagiand - who masterminded the plan - was handed the most severe sentence of 25 years without parole for drug smuggling. While the two people who helped him, Saud Siregar and Ismunandar, will spend up to 20 years in prison and can apply for parole in 2017. In exchange for the trio, Ms Bishop wanted Chan and Sukuraman's death sentences reduced to life in prison. Chan's brother, Michael (right), and girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (left) tried to visit the inmate before he was put into an armoured car but were rebuffed by prison officers . Earlier this week, it was thought they would be transferred at midday but officials jumped the gun and bailed the pair out early on Wednesday morning just after 5am local time . Heavily armoured police lined the gates of Kerobokan prison as they prepared for the duo's transfer . Coming through the main entrance, the duo were taken to Denpasar airport where they were flown to Central Java . But the suggestion, which was made during a 30-minute conversation, was not accepted by the government, according to sources. This exchange was offered up after Chan and Sukuraman were transferred from Kerobokan prison - which had been their home for 10 years - after 5am local time on Wednesday. Chan's brother, Michael, and girlfriend, Febyanti Herewila, tried to visit the inmate before he was put into an armoured car but were rebuffed by prison officers. Later that day, Michael Chan told News Corp he was 'devastated' and in shock that his brother's execution was going ahead. Mother of Andrew Chan, Helen (centre), looked downcast as she escorted through Sydney International Airport en route to Indonesia following the pair's transfer . 'I am still trying to register it all. I still can't believe it has happened. I don't even know what to say to be quite frank,' he said. It is not known when Chan and Sukuraman will be executed but Fairfax Media is reporting they will be shot dead this weekend. Indonesia's attorney general H.M. Prasetyo is tipped to make an announcement about the time of their deaths on Friday. The pair will be given 72 hours' notice before they are killed by a firing squad at Nusakambangan. Indonesia has allocated about $20,000 for each prisoner in its 'execution budget' to kill the duo. Nusakambangan was chosen as the venue for their deaths because it was cheaper than other locations.

Paul Wainscoat, who was married to Sandera for 11 months before filing for divorce, says her 'drinking' led to frequent fights between the pair, and a few that even turned physical. In fact, prior to their marriage, police were called to the house and she was arrested for domestic battery after an incident between her and Wainscoat. Scroll down for video . The ex-husband of Clint Eastwood's new girlfriend Christina Sandera (above) revealed she has been  arrested for domestic battery after he claims she physically assaulted him while they were dating . Ex-husband Paul Wainscoat,  claims that on July 17, 2002,  she became enraged when he refused to move in with her, and when he tried to leave 'grabbed onto his shirt and scratched his neck to prevent him. He called police, arrested her for domestic battery . Wainscoat tells The National Enquirer that on July 17, 2002, just two months after he began dating Sandera, she became enraged when he refused to move in with her, and when he tried to leave 'grabbed onto his shirt and scratched his neck to prevent him.' He managed to call the police, who in their report, noted a 'strong odor' of alcohol on Sandera's breath as they arrested her for domestic battery. The couple still married eight months later though, after, according to Wainscoat, he spent $80,000  on the couple's honeymoon and jewelry and 'dental work' for his bride. A few months after they married another physical fight broke out between the pair, with Wainscoat claiming that this time Sandera went into a rage as she was 'distraught due to the recent death of one of her cats.' He claims she began screaming at him 'Where are my kittens?' and then began hitting him with a closed fist before throwing 'a full bottle of Gatorade, which hit him in the back of the head.' He says he did not file charges on account of her 'drinking.' Wainscoat also describes other instances of 'bizarre behavior,' including a time that Sandera threatened to 'axe' their furniture if he left her. Sandera now lives in the $20million mansion (above) Eastwood recently completed building in Carmel, California . Eastwood and his ex-wife Dina (above) split in 2013 . The marriage finally blew up in June 2003, when police responded to another domestic disturbance with Wainscoat claiming he was 'being battered by his wife.' In court papers Sandera said she was not an alcoholic but had quit booze and attended AA meetings. This could possibly explain why Margot Robbie claims Eastwood gave her a glare when she popped a bottle of champagne in front of the two during the Academy Awards ceremony. In addition, Sandera said she attended '15 anger management classes.' 'It was hell,' says Wainscoat of the relationship. 'I wish Clint all the luck in the world with that woman.'

While out on bail and local charges last year, he still used his Katie Caponetti name online while using a personal laptop he kept in the rectory at SS. Simon and Jude's. Despite the new allegations against Haynes he was released on Tuesday and was ordered to pay $5,000 bail at the end of the week. U.S. District Judge Lawrence F.

Executives from Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, said the decision to end the circus's century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length as elephants have often been featured on Ringling's posters over the decades. 'There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers,' said Alana Feld, the company's executive vice president. 'A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants.' Scroll down for video . The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus has announced they are phasing out their elephant acts, and will eliminate them in 2018 . The decision was largely based on the fact that many cities have anti-circus and anti-elephant ordinances in addition to public outcry . 13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the company's 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida . Feld owns 43 elephants, and 29 of the giant animals live at the company's 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida. 13 animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018 while one elephant is on a breeding loan to the Fort Worth Zoo. Another reason for the decision, company President Kenneth Feld said, was that certain cities and counties have passed 'anti-circus' and 'anti-elephant' ordinances. The company's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year, and Feld said it's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction. It's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations, he said. 'All of the resources used to fight these things can be put towards the elephants,' Feld said during an interview at the Center for Elephant Conservation. 'We're not reacting to our critics; we're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the Asian elephant.' The circus will continue to use other animals - this year it added a Mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders to its Circus Xtreme show and it will likely showcase more motorsports, daredevils and feats of humans' physical capabilities. Ringling's popular Canada-based competitor, Cirque du Soleil, features human acts and doesn't use wild animals. 'There are endless possibilities,' said Juliette Feld, another executive vice president of the company and a producer of Feld's Marvel Universe Live, Disney on Ice and Monster Jam shows, among others. Feld owns the largest herd of Asian elephants in North America. It costs about $65,000 yearly to care for each elephant, and Kenneth Feld said the company would have to build new structures to house the retiring elephants at the center, located in between Orlando and Tampa on a rural, ranchlike property. Kenneth Feld said initially the center will be open only to researchers, scientists and others studying the Asian elephant. Eventually, he 'hopes it expands to something the public will be able to see.' 'I want everybody's grandkids to be able to see Asian elephants,' he said. The center's youngest elephant is Mike, who will be 2 in August, and the oldest is Mysore, who is 69. One elephant, 6-year-old Barack, was conceived by artificial insemination. Since the center opened in 1995, 26 elephants have been born there.

Kenneth Feld, CEO of Feld Entertainment, feeds Alana and Icky at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation in Florida . There will be a new structure built to house the retiring elephants, and the company hopes to open the conservation to the public eventually . Ringling's elephants have been at the center of lawsuits and ongoing complaints from animal rights activists. In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal-rights groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year legal battle over unproven allegations that Ringling circus employees mistreated elephants. The initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former Ringling barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $190,000 by the animal-rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit. The judge called him 'essentially a paid plaintiff' who lacked credibility and standing to sue. The judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial. Kenneth Feld testified during that trial about elephants' importance to the show. 'The symbol of the Greatest Show on Earth is the elephant, and that's what we've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years.' When asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants, Feld replied, 'No, it wouldn't.' This week, Feld said, 'Things have changed.' 'How does a business be successful? By adapting,' he said. Feld noted that when his father bought the circus in 1967, there was still a human sideshow featuring acts such as the bearded lady and other human oddities. His father did away with that, he said. 'We're always changing and we're always learning,' he said. In 2008, Feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties, including monster truck shows, motocross and the International Hot Rod Association, which promotes drag races and other events. In 2010, it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz. Roughly 30 million people attend one of Feld's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year.",

        "input_text": "Just 19 months ago, Nathan Matthews posed happily with his teenage stepsister Becky Watts as their parents married. His girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, also smiled as she stood alongside the teenager and the delighted newlyweds. Yesterday, Matthews and Hoare stood emotionless in the dock to face charges after 16-year-old Becky’s dismembered body was discovered 80 yards from their home earlier this week. Delivery driver Matthews, 28, is accused of murdering his stepsister. Hoare, 21, is accused of ‘consistently lying to police’ in an attempt to protect her boyfriend. Scroll down for videos . A photograph from Darren and Anjie Galsworthy's 2013 wedding has emerged showing Matthews (far left) next to the couple, with Hoare (next to Mrs Galsworthy) and Becky (right) as bridesmaids . Nathan Matthews, the stepbrother of Becky Watts, was remanded in custody this morning after he appeared in court charged with the 16-year-old's murder. He is pictured in a court sketch of the short hearing . Matthews's girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, also pictured in a sketch by a court artist, appeared in a separate hearing in the same packed courtroom charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice . Their separate court appearances were a stark contrast to the wedding photograph which was taken by a family friend in August 2013, after Becky’s father Darren Galsworthy, 51, married Matthews’ mother Anjie, 49, at a church ceremony in St George, Bristol. Nearly 100 guests attended a reception at the nearby Bendix Club, Kingswood, where Becky and her stepbrother were seen laughing and joking together. Matthews, who held his and Hoare’s young daughter in the picture, was dressed in the same grey suit and cream waistcoat as his stepfather. Hoare and Becky wore matching blue bridesmaid dresses. At Bristol Magistrates’ Court yesterday, the accused were both dressed in baggy blue t-shirts as they were led into the dock handcuffed to a guard. Matthews spoke only to give his name and address during his short appearance, before being remanded to appear via video link in the city’s crown court today. Nathan Matthews (left) was remanded in custody and will appear via video link before Bristol Crown Court tomorrow. Hoare (right) was remanded in custody and will appear at the same court on April 2 . Becky, 16, was last seen at her home in the St George's area of Bristol on February 19. Body parts thought to belong to the teenager were found on Monday night after police were called to an address in Barton Hill . Minutes later, his girlfriend appeared in court, holding her arm across her stomach as she listened to the charge against her. It read: ‘Between February 18 and March 1 you did a series of acts which had the tendency to pervert the course of public justice, in that you hindered the police investigation to assist Nathan Matthews and intended for him to avoid detection for the murder of Rebecca Watts.’ District Judge Lynne Matthews remanded her to appear in court next month. A small group gathered outside screamed abuse and hit the side of the custody van as the defendants were driven away. Matthews, seen in another court sketch, was handcuffed to a female dock officer as he appeared in court . Hoare, also seen in a court sketch, wore a dark coloured short-sleeved T shirt and had shoulder-length brown hair, which appeared unwashed . No details of the case were given as Matthews stood handcuffed to a dock officer before being led away . Hoare, who lives in the Barton Hill area of Bristol, was remanded in custody to appear at Bristol Crown Court for a preliminary hearing on April 2 . Mr and Mrs Galsworthy, who made televised TV appeals together after Becky went missing, were not at the hearing yesterday. Becky vanished from her home in Bristol on the morning of February 19. Police launched a huge search operation after she was reported missing the following afternoon. But on Monday night, detectives discovered her ‘cut up’ body at a house in Barton Hill, Bristol. A further four men and a woman are still being quizzed by police after being arrested on suspicion of assisting Becky’s killer following the discovery of her body. Police were yesterday granted a further 24 hours to interview them. The van believed to be carrying Nathan Matthews leaves Bristol Magistrates' Court after the short hearing . As a white custody van left the court shortly before 11am, members of the public who had been waiting outside the court banged on the sides of the vehicle and yelled abuse as it drove away .

        "input_text": "A tumour growing inside of Amanda Murphy caused a headache so severe that it drove her to stab herself in the head with a knife to try and relieve the pain. What is even more shocking is that surgeons found hair and teeth inside her tumour when they removed it from her right ovary. Amanda's ordeal started three days before Christmas when she went to work with a blistering headache. Amanda Murphy, from Rutherford in New South Wales, was struck down with a headache just before Christmas . A tumour found in ovary caused her to stab herself in the head and go into a psychosis. Amanda's (left) sister, Rachael (right), had to watch her sister go through the ordeal . As the day wore on and the pain did not go away, Amanda, from Rutherford in New South Wales, texted her sister - Rachael - who told her to go to the sick bay. When Rachael, 27, visited her later in the day, she became concerned when Amanda complained there was 'something in my head' and she needed to get it out. The 27-year-old told that's life! Amanda's forehead did look swollen so she took her to hospital, where doctors did some tests and found nothing wrong with her. They sent the sisters back home with painkillers for Amanda - who is a mine truck driver - to take. But her condition did not improve. The 28-year-old spent the next two days in an agitated state, with her boyfriend - Nathan - reporting she could not sleep. On Christmas Day, Rachael told Daily Mail Australia her father had left messages to say her sister had been re-admitted to hospital. It took specialists weeks to diagnose Amanda's condition, which caused her to experience mood swings . Amanda before the tumour took over her body and drove her to take up a knife and stab herself in the head to relieve the pressure of her headache . Frantically, she rushed to be at her sister's bedside but nothing prepared her for what she would see when she walked into Amanda's room. 'She had blood on top of her head, she was strapped to the bed and rocking back forth while they were trying to do the lumbar puncture,' Rachael said. The condition mostly affects young women who end up in being misdiagnosed and are admitted into psychiatric care or display behaviour so erratic they are kept in intensive care, according to the ABC. The tumour found on the ovary is named a teratoma, which could possibly have teeth, hair or brain tissue. This tricks the body's immune system into attacking the brain. Her father told Rachael that Amanda had tried to stab herself in the head with a knife. 'She was so distraught about the pressure on her head that she had tried sucking it out with a vacuum prior to doing it with a knife,' Rachael told Daily Mail Australia. The situation had escalated so much that the police had to be called to calm Amanda down before she was taken to hospital. When the tests from the lumbar puncture came back, doctors diagnosed her with encephalitis. Encephalitis happens when the brain becomes swollen and inflamed from a virus. But after days of treatment it was clear Amanda was not responding, falling into a psychosis where she did eat or sleep. Surgeons found an 8cm tumour on Amanda's right ovary, which had hair and teeth inside it . Amanda and partner Nathan who stayed with her throughout the ordeal in hospital . One time Rachael fed her sister water and she spat it out at her. Amanda would also throw abuse at her loved ones and hospital staff. Things got so bad that Amanda was transferred to the psychiatric ward at Sydney's Mater Hospital where she could be supervised by a nurse 24 hours a day. Her behaviour became increasingly worse, to the point where she was yelling and being aggressive towards Rachael and staff, but in the next moment she was staring into space. Before her illness, Rachael described her sister as 'very outgoing'. 'She was always the one to have a comeback. She was very cheeky,' Rachael told Daily Mail Australia. '[She] was a completely different [person], it wasn't her at all.' For weeks, Amanda's condition had specialists puzzled but finally they got their answer. After performing an ultrasound on her abdomen, doctors found a benign tumour on her right ovary containing brain matter, which was causing the immune system to attack her brain. One nurse likened it to 'a monster growing inside' of Amanda. Her condition, ovarian teratoma encephalitis, is believed to only affect one in seven people. Surgeons removed the 8cm tumour on her ovary, but there was another surprise inside it - hair and teeth. But it was a long road to recovery for the truck driver who spent another two months in hospital and went through a brain-injury rehabilitation clinic. Amanda told Daily Mail Australia she had no memory of the weeks she was affected by her tumour. 'I don't remember anything from first week of hospital to nearly the February after that,' she said. 'I don’t remember waking up until mid-February. That was when I was able to think on my own.' Despite the months that have passed, Rachael thinks her sister is still not back to the Amanda she knew. 'She's not Amanda she was prior to getting sick. She's not 100 per cent I don't think.' For more real life stories, see this week’s issue of that’s life! magazine, on sale now.",

        "input_text": "For PBS science correspondent Miles O'Brien, seeing on film the aftermath of the freak accident that resulted in the amputation of his left arm above the elbow proved more difficult than he had anticipated. He had an early look at the documentary, Miles O'Brien: A Life Lost and Found, narrated by his friend, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. It premieres on CNN next Tuesday at 9pm. 'I was a little bit taken aback by how much it affected me emotionally,' O'Brien said. 'We all want to talk about this linear, analogue thing — here's when you grieve, here's when you do therapy, here's where you get back to work. But that's not how we all live.' Scroll down for video . Amputee: PBS science correspondent Mile O'Brien (center) lost his left arm above the elbow last February after an accident while on assignment in Asia . Alarming diagnosis: A heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm, casing acute compartment syndrome - a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm . O'Brien, 55, used to be CNN's top science correspondent until the network laid off his entire unit. He appears on the network as an occasional analyst, such as during coverage of last spring's missing Malaysia Airlines plane, but does most of his freelance work now for PBS NewsHour. He was on assignment for PBS in Japan and the Philippines in February 2014 when a heavy case of equipment fell on his left forearm. It caused a nasty bruise, but not enough to stop O'Brien from working. He wanted to finish his stories and escape for a few days on a beach. The following night, his pain increased and O'Brien sought medical attention. He was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome, a condition where his swollen muscles blocked blood flow in his arm. As he was getting ready for surgery, he searched the Internet for details on a diagnosis he had never heard before, and grew alarmed when words like 'life-threatening' and 'amputation' popped up. Fateful trip: In Febraury 2014, O'Brien (pictured) traveled to Japan and the Philippines to report on 3D printing when the accident occurred . Illusion: Waking up after the amputation, O'Brien could feel his left arm, but it was only a phantom limb . Denial: O'Brien continued working on his stories after being discharged from the hospital and didn't tell his family back home about the amputation . Waking up after surgery, O'Brien's first inclination was that he caught a break. He could feel his left arm, the fingers on his hand. But it was an illusion, a phantom limb. His arm was gone. He checked out of the hospital two days later and spent more than a week in a Philippines hotel, finishing his PBS stories. In an extreme form of denial, the divorced father of two told no one what had happened, even his children. They were dark days, and he told Gupta he even considered suicide. 'I had never lost an arm before,' he said, drily. 'I wasn't sure how that would go.' Two weeks after the amputation, he wrote in a blog post- typed with one hand with the help of a voice recognition software: 'Life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you. Actually, I would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now — in more ways than one.' During an interview on the Today Show in March 2014, about a month after his accident, O'Brien described what happened to him as 'mind-boggling.' Unstoppable: The 55-year-old reporter has learned how to ride a bicycle one-handed with the help of a special contraption (pictured) O'Brien had never been the sort of person who reached out for help. And he wanted to prove to himself he could move forward and still do his job. When he found out about the amputation through the February blog post O'Brien had written, Gupta was worried. 'I wasn't surprised by Miles' reaction,' he said. 'My concern was, was this his form of therapy or was he delaying the inevitable psychological crash by not dealing with it emotionally?' O'Brien has tried to prove he can maintain his active life beyond work, with some missteps. He started running, but losing an arm affected his balance and he took some nasty spills. He broke his nose one time when he reached to break his fall with an arm that was no longer there. A woman who came upon him was horrified — look what happened to his arm! — and O'Brien had to explain he didn't lose it in the fall. With the help of a prosthetic arm, he completed a 300-mile bike ride to honor his late sister, Gupta pedaling by his side. The licensed pilot has also been testing out how to fly again with his new disability. Growing pains: The divorced father of two has been learning how to perform simple everyday tasks like cutting a bagel and getting dressed on his own . He's learning about the oddities of pain in a phantom limb, how to work with new prosthetics and how to negotiate simple tasks — getting dressed, cutting a bagel — that he never had to think twice about before. When filming the CNN special, O'Brien knew what Gupta was up to when his friend asked him to read on camera some of the emails that Gupta had sent to him a year ago. He was trying to make him cry. It worked. The emotional journey, still not completed, has been one of self-discovery. He's learned that there's no weakness in asking for help. He realizes what loved ones and even strangers think of him, and it has been overwhelming. 'If I had to trade it — that arm for the knowledge and the love that I feel?' he said. 'I'll go with the love. It's a hell of a way to learn a lesson.'",

Pelle Wall testified in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom and described how happy and energetic his mother, Uta von Schwedler, had been in the year before she died, a death that was initially thought to be a suicide but is now believed by authorities to be a carefully plotted out murder on the part of her ex-husband and Pelle's father, John Wall. Pelle also described his father's erratic behavior in the hours after his mother died, including a moment when he sat down on his son's bed and said to the young man, then still a teenager, 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?' Scroll down for video . Pelle Wall (above) took the stand in the murder trial of his mother, Uta von Schwedler, in a Salt Lake City, Utah courtroom on Wednesday . Pelle testified against his father John Wall (above), who is accused of killing his ex-wife and staging it to look like a suicide . According to the Deseret News, John had a very tempestuous relationship with his ex, and Pelle testified he would often say negative things about the woman in front of their children, telling them 'Uta's a bad parent' or 'Uta's making my life difficult.' He said on the stand the two would often argue when it came to the children, and that the last time he saw the two together, John rolled up his car window and drove off with the couple's four children in the middle of a conversation that the two were having in von Schwelder's driveway. Uta Von Schwedler (above) was found in her bathtub on Sept. 27, 2011 with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of Xanax in her system . The next morning Pelle said he father was nowhere to be found, and when he returned home from school that afternoon he said the man had a large cut above his eye. Von Schwedler was found in her bathtub later that day with multiple cuts to her body and a high level of Xanax in her system. That night, John woke his son up while he was sleeping and began displaying 'erratic behavior,' saying 'Uta's dead and they think I did it.' He then asked his son, 'Am I a monster?' and 'What if I killed her and I don't remember?' Pelle testified that his mother had never taken any prescription pills or antidepressants to his knowledge, remembering her as 'happy' and 'energetic.' He also said that while his father initially seemed sad following the death of his ex-wife, that soon turned 'more toward anger, hatred.' He also noted that after his parents first divorced, while he was still in elementary school, the children spent most of their time with their father, but that had changed in the years leading up to his mother's death, with custody split between the two parents, something that angered his father. The 21-year-old has long believed his father killed his mother, moving out of his home when he turned 18 and petitioning the court to remove his three younger siblings from his father's care shortly after. John, a pediatrician, has pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder.",

        "input_text": "Lewis Lowe, pictured, stole the £60,000 Porsche 911 Carrera GTS from outside solicitor Paul Ackroyd's home and took it on a 100mph joyride . A car thief wrote off a lawyer's luxury Porsche during a 104mph police chase - not realising it was a model so rare it was one of only four in Britain. Lewis Lowe, 24, stole the 2011 911 Carrera GTS in broad daylight after spotting the car parked on the driveway of personal injury specialist Paul Ackroyd who at the time was on a family ski-ing holiday in Austria. Just half an hour later, Lowe, of Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, was spotted by police driving the £60,000 car - described as Mr Ackroyd's 'pride and joy' on the M60, and a six-mile high speed chase commenced along the motorway. Lowe weaved in and out of traffic at 100mph, forcing cars to move and slow down dangerously, before he attempted to move on to the A666 towards Bolton at the same speed. The high-powered vehicle eventually slewed out of control and ended up in bramble bushes on the embankment where it was damaged beyond repair. Tragically, it later emerged father of three Mr Ackroyd, 46, had been planning to take his 11 year old disabled son Edward on a road trip in the Porsche around the Scottish Highlands on return from the skiing trip, as the boy's disability meant he had not been able to go to Austria. At Manchester Crown Court, Lowe was jailed for two years after earlier admitting aggravated vehicle taking, burglary, dangerous driving and driving without a licence and insurance. After the case Mr Ackroyd a founding partner of a law firm in Rochdale said: 'I got a call when I was away on holiday from the tracking company. You just feel so helpless. The first thing I wanted to know was whether they had been on the house or just stolen the car. It was devastating to find that they had been in the house as well. 'It had taken me a long time to find that car. There were only four on the market and it had taken me nine months to find the right one. I love motoring and cars are my passion. It was the special edition so it was a really special car. I only bought the car in October last year and the kids loved it. 'Edward is terminally ill with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and he in particular adored the car. In many ways I bought the car because of him. He couldn't come on holiday with us in January so the two of us were going to do a grand tour of the Scottish Highlands in the car. 'It is only a car but it meant so much to him. It has been very upsetting. I drive a Volvo estate as my everyday car and the tour in Scotland wouldn't be the same in that car.' The court heard the theft occurred at 1pm on January 23 after opportunist Lowe spotted the Porsche and sneaked around the outside of Mr Ackroyd's cottage in Oldham to establish it was empty. He smashed through patio doors and helped himself to iPods, a PlayStation3 and the keys to the car before driving away in it. Lowe broke into Mr Ackroyd's home, stole electronic goods as well as his 'pride and joy' Porsche 911 . Mr Ackroyd was planning to take his terminally ill son on a driving holiday around Scotland in the car . The car, pictured, was written-off after Lowe lost control at 100mph and crashed into an embankment . Shortly afterwards Mr Ackroyd who had a tracking device fitted inside the Porsche, got a call from a vehicle tracking company who said his car was on the move. Prosecuting, Juliette Berry said: 'The police having received information about the stolen car saw it on the M60 in Prestwich. Officers from the Tactical Aid Unit notified other colleagues. 'The defendant realised the police had seen him and while still on the motorway accelerated away and drove in and out of traffic. They activated the emergency equipment and a pursuit commenced. He tried to negotiate to the slip road at 100mph, left the road and hit the embankment causing the vehicle to stop. The airbags were deployed and the vehicle was damaged. Lowe tried to flee on foot but soon gave himself up to officers and admitted he had stolen the vehicle earlier that day. The tracking device fitted to Mr Ackroyd's car later provided evidence that Lowe had also sped through a residential 30mph zone in the country town of Slaithwaite at 82mph and he hit a top speed of 104mph before the crash. Miss Berry added: 'The Porsche was worth £60,000. I understand it is particularly rare. There were only four in the country and the impact upon Mr Ackroyd has been significant. He was on holiday with two children. The third child is disabled and was unable to go. Father and son had planned a road trip around the Scottish Highlands in the vehicle and were unable to do that and his son was very upset.' In a statement, Mr Ackroyd said his children are now reluctant to stay at his home as they don't feel safe and he has been forced to increase security. Defending Lowe, who has 10 previous convictions for 20 offences, Sara Haq said: 'He expresses that he fully embraces a custodial sentence because he acknowledges at the time of the offences he was not coping with life in the community and custody provides him with the stability he can't find in the community. The defendant is glad to be there. 'He accepts that he was looking for something to steal that day and came across a house that was clearly unoccupied with an attractive vehicle on the driveway and he took the opportunity.' Sentencing Judge Maurice Greene said: 'There were only four in the country of this particular type of car. You were tempted by this vehicle and drove it away. You were seen by the police but decided to try and escape because you were, I suspect, looking for the excitement of driving at speed. 'A £60,000 vehicle was written off which was devastating for Mr Ackroyd as it was his pride and joy and we also heard about how his children feel about the intrusion to his house. That's the traumatic effect a house burglary has. It's not always what is taken but the intrusion to a place people are entitled to feel safe. It is really by luck more than anything else neither you nor other people were killed.' Lowe was jailed for two years at Manchester Crown Court, pictured, after admitting the theft . After the case Detective Constable Adam Frank said: 'It is a miracle that Lowe did not kill either himself or someone else. He drove in such a reckless way and at such dangerous speeds that if he had crashed into another car, I have no doubt we could be talking today about a fatality. 'He also showed no signs of slowing down or giving himself up until he crashed into an embankment, suffering only the indignity of some scratches from the brambles he tried to run through and the cuff marks when we arrested him. 'I am pleased to see Lowe behind bars, not least because he is a burglar who could still be out there today targeting people's homes. I am sure the streets are much safer with this reckless and foolhardy individual behind bars. 'But also for the family who have suffered tremendously from Lowe's actions. He invaded the sanctity of their home, stole their property and wrecked a very expensive car.

        "input_text": "The White House, the State Department and Democrats on Capitol Hill are side-stepping questions about Hillary Clinton as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates. While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene. Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business . Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I’m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any 'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State . Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth … we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata. Supporters of Clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year's nomination to Barack Obama . Retiring California Sen. Barbara Boxer was one of the few Democratic senators to stand by Clinton. 'That's a nothing burger. Total,' she told National Journal. 'There isn't one secretary of State that ever did that because the law didn't change until after she left, so they're making a mountain out of a molehill,' she added. Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he'd 'be surprised if a number of secretaries of State hadn't done that for as long as we've had email.' 'That's all I'm going to say,' he added. New York Rep. Steve Israel blamed Republicans  for the mess and accused them of 'trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal.' 'That's what they do here,' he told CNN. 'Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between. Just add this to the list.' It is true that Clinton's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business. But other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff. Nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure. They weren't actively considering a bid for president, either. Reporters showered White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions on Wednesday about the Clinton email controversy. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps . Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent. 'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions,' Axelrod said on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, according to The Hill. 'Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?' he asked. 'By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. So lack of speed kills in this case,' the former White House official said. The State Department has said that Clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question. And Clinton, first through a spokesman, and then through Twitter has touched on the issue. She has not explained why she did what she did, though, or responded to any of the other questions Axelrod - and the media - put forward. A Democratic strategist who spoke to The Hill warned that if Clinton can't make the story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata. 'We’re probably a month or so away [from the campaign launch] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks, you’re going to see chatter among Democratic operatives saying, \"Maybe we need another person in this race.\" And that is really problematic.' 'When you do stuff like this, man, you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags,' The Hill's source said. 'It’s kinda weird.'",

        "input_text": "Rugby union has a well-worn reputation for being the game of the elite and now we have the indisputable proof, that you indeed need to spend flash dollars to watch the rah-rahs best in action. In a Daily Mail Australia investigation into the cost of taking a family to the football, the Queensland Reds' Super Rugby games at Suncorp Stadium came in a long last, costing about $90 more than the best value - the Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium. With family budgets on a tighter rein than ever before, the challenge is where to best spend your sporting dollar. And judging by the secrets kept by some stadia and their teams, you get the distinct impression they don't really want you to know. So we decided to put them to the test and try and settle the argument, once and for all, by piecing together a direct comparison of a day (or night) out, for a family of four, to the home ground of the top two supported teams in each code. Winners are grinners. Asian champions Western Sydney Wanderers have played before packed houses at Pirtek Stadium for the past two years but while they are testing their fans' resolve this season in the A League they can still boast that they are looking after their loyal followers when it comes to pricing . The Rabbitohs, with almost 32,000 members to their name, kick off their title defence in the NRL on Thursday against rugby league's other best supported club, the Brisbane Broncos but both fall just short in the pricing against AFL's best supported club Collingwood . The Magpies playing at both the MCG and Etihad provide good value for a family of fans, particularly after the home of AFL announced it would cut the cost of food and beverages. Collingwood can boast the biggest following of any Australian football club with almost 70,000 members . The Queensland Reds have one of the largest membership bases with 28,000 now signed up. While Suncorp Stadium is considered among the best to watch football in Australia following the Super Rugby does not come cheap, ranking last in the Daily Mail's assessment in value for money . Rugby League launches into action tonight with the premiers South Sydney tackling the Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium, considered by many the premier sporting venue in Queensland. But does it stack up against Victoria's home of AFL, the MCG? Or what about the tight-knit groups at Pirtek Stadium which back Asian Champions League winners, Western Sydney Wanderers or AAMI Park's A League toppers, Melbourne Victory. It was on the following criteria; a family ticket in general admission (2 adults and 2 children), with the purchase of two meat pies, two hot dogs and two buckets of chips plus one beer, one soft drink and two bottles of water, as well as two supporter caps. Clubs, governing bodies, trusts and stadiums were invited to provide the relevant information. And the winner is: Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium in Parramatta. The Asian Champions League title-holders provide their 17,000 (capped) devoted followers with great value at $147.80. Such was the push for membership that officials had to restrict the number in line with the capacity at Pirtek and the club placed more than a thousand hopefuls on a waiting list. 1. Western Sydney Wanderers at Pirtek Stadium Parramatta $147.80 . 2. Collingwood Magpies at Melbourne Cricket Ground $155.10 . 3. South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium Homebush Bay $163.50 . 4. Adelaide Crows at Adelaide Oval $178.78 . 5. Brisbane Broncos at Suncorp Stadium $202.80 . 6. Queensland Reds at Suncorp Stadium $236.04 . *Based on prices from clubs, stadiums and governing bodies . Sometimes it's the little things, as Pirtek catering officials were quick to point out, that their meat pies and chips all come with sauce included in the price. The MCG was fast out of the blocks, this week, ahead of the AFL bounce, touting a drop in prices for a pie at the footy, a move which was widely acclaimed by supporters. A game at 'the G', watching Collingwood do battle against Essendon on Anzac Day, for instance, will set you back just $155.10 for a family outing. Souths at ANZ Stadium and the Crows at Adelaide Oval come in 3rd and 4th. Suncorp Stadium is arguably the best venue in Australia to watch the footy but unfortunately what is beyond reasonable doubt, is that you pay for the privilege, as can be seen by the price of a Broncos game $202.80. The Reds confirm it by taking out the value wooden spoon, by far the most expensive at $236.04. There's no argument that the matter of pricing in the competitive Australian market has become an increasingly thorny issue. While some happily revealed the costs, others were not so forthcoming. Of those who were requested the information, the South Sydney Rabbitohs and Queensland Reds were fastest to act, providing all the details requested within in a relatively short period of time. So too, the Wanderers and Broncos. But others were not so forthcoming, preferring to completely sidestep the issue, including the NSW Waratahs. The Super Rugby champions simply referred DMA to their website and Ticketek for details of pricing. Their home ground of Allianz Stadium, run by the SCG Trust, refused to reveal what they charge for a meat pie and beer. Perhaps worse, the Adelaide Crows did not reply to repeated requests for the figures, even over a 48-hour period. However, in stark contrast, Adelaide Oval officials, provided a quick and detailed summary and also highlighted the added extras of an event at the revamped home of South Australian sport, including the ability for supporters to take their own 'packed lunch and thermos'. More reason to cheer their team. Western Sydney Wanderers fans get the best deal when it comes to supporting a football club in Australia. They topped the ranks in Daily Mail's value for money investigation . The heat is on. While Suncorp and the Reds offered up all details, Allianz Stadium, which is home to Super Rugby champions the NSW Waratahs, chose not to reveal any details of how much it costs for food and drink at a big game . A WSW home game at Pirtek ranks among the most enjoyable for football fans in Australia, its atmosphere rivalled now by its value for money for loyal supporters . And Adelaide Oval is also one of few where boutique beers are available to punters in the general admission areas. On the same day the NRL season was to kick off and with ANZ Stadium playing host to both last year's grand finalists - the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs, officials there said there was no information on pricing which could be provided, only a week out from hosting their first league game of 2015. Melbourne Victory was also unable to provide a breakdown. The pressure has been turned up on all codes as a result of the new deal struck by the Melbourne Cricket Club with its catering contractor. They've reduced the price of a range of products on sale at the stadium in a bid to make going to the football and cricket more family-friendly. In all, eight items have been reduced with bottled water undergoing the biggest price drop from $5 to $3 - that's a discount of about 40 per cent. Suncorp also plays host to the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL. The cost of a family going to watch Queensland's most successful rugby league club is about $202 . MCC chief executive Stephen Gough estimated the price restructure will cost the MCC about $14 million in lost revenue over the course of the seven-year contract. 'We've listened to the fans,' Gough said. 'We understand their affordability concerns and we are very confident that this initiative will be extremely well received.' AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan called on venues around the country to follow the MCG's lead. 'They've made a big statement,' McLachlan said. 'They're leading the agenda now on this issue. Hopefully it's a great outcome for all of our fans across Australia because I think they've put a position out there that people are going to have to respond to.' Etihad Stadium is still negotiating with the AFL on prices but venue management hopes to make an announcement on food pricing before the start of the season. The Adelaide Crows huddle before a match at the Adelaide Oval - where entry conditions are quite relaxed including being able to bring a thermos and packed lunch to the big game .",

The 13-year-old boy, whose name is being withheld, was caught when another boy was seen handing him a knife in the cafeteria at Sunrise Middle School in Fort Lauderdale. Upon further inspection, it was revealed he was also carrying a .357 Smith & Wesson firearm, another knife,  ammunition, a mask and fireworks. Scroll down for video . A 13-year-old boy was found carrying a .357 Smith & Wesson firearm (similar to the one above), another knife, ammunition, a mask and fireworks in his backpack at a Florida school . The Sun-Sentinel reports that the student was placed on involuntary hold under the Baker Act, which allows authorities in Florida to examine the mental health of an individual and see if they are a harm to themself or others. The teenager was eventually released, but could now face charges of weapons possession and disruption of a school function. Both the boy's mother and attorney, Jim Stark, refused requests for comment. The student who was caught giving the other boy a knife was also taken in under the Baker Act and released. His age and identity are not known at this time. Principal Michael Walker notified parents of the incident in an email last Friday, and this week assured them that the school was safe, though he did not reveal any specifics of what had occurred on that day. Despite his assurances however, many teachers are still afraid. 'It seems calculated, whatever the [student's] plan was,' said Mary Fitzgerald, a schoolteacher for over 35 years and the school's teachers union steward. 'I've never, never in all the years of teaching, even heard of this in Broward County.' The incident occured at Sunrise Middle School (above) in Fort Lauderdale . Another meeting has been scheduled for Thursday evening with faculty, and a more detailed account of what happened has been posted in an online forum only accessible by staff at the school. Under school guidelines, possession of a Class A weapon is grounds for expulsion. 'Student safety is always the District's highest priority, and the school followed all the proper protocols and have worked to keep parents informed,' said Cathleen Brennan, a spokeswoman for Broward County Public Schools. Teachers however still seem unsure of how to deal with last week's event with their students. 'If teachers feel safe, the students will feel safe,' said Fitzgerald. 'They sense it.'",

The harrowing scene played out in Maricopa Country Superior Court as Judge Sherry Stephens declared a mistrial meaning Arias, 34, would not be able to face the death penalty. Tanisha Sorenson was overcome with grief and held her face in her hand as other members of Alexander's family wept while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life. Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said, 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' It is now up to the judge to decide if Arias gets 25-years to-life with parole or without parole and Stephens told the court she would announce this in April. Scroll Down for Video . Impassive: Jodi Arias watches the jury enter the courtroom for her sentencing phase retrial in Phoenix on Thursday morning . Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . Agony: Tanisha Sorenson becomes inconsolable after hearing that Jodi Arias has escaped the death penalty . Arias' mother, Sandra, broke down too and received a hug from a friend. It is the second time a jury has failed to decide on life or death for Arias, 34, and under Arizona state law she cannot be tried again - a sore disappointment for the prosecution who have always sought execution. Indeed, it was revealed afterwards that jurors who deadlocked on punishment for convicted murderer Jodi Arias say they were split 11-1 in favor of the death penalty and that they tried unsuccessfully to get the lone dissenter, a woman, kicked off the panel. Fourteen jurors, including at least one alternate and one woman removed from the panel earlier, talked to reporters Thursday after the verdict. None of them would reveal their names. Many of the jurors said Arias lacked remorse and some said she tried to manipulate them. Jurors also said they believed the holdout was biased and that the woman even had an agenda. 'The one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning,' a male juror said according to AZ Central. 'The 11 of us strived for justice, but to no avail,' another juror, who was also not identified, said. 'We absolutely feel the penalty should have been death.' Realization: Sorenson raises her hand to her face as she breaks down in tears after Jodi Arias verdict was announced . The Alexander family released a statement to say they are 'saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time.' 'Obviously, as I said, during the closing arguments, during the opening statements, and several times during the trial, that the events of June 4, 2008 were a tragedy, and the no verdict ultimately could repair that sadness. I don't think today's victory will repair any sadness or change anything but we hope it can begin the closure process for all those who were affected by that tragedy. Thank you,' Arias' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi told reporters Thursday. 'Travis Alexander's surviving brothers and sisters Gary Alexander, Dennis \"Greg\" Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson, Samantha Alexander, Hillary Wilcox, Steven Alexander and Allie Iglesias are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. 'However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time. They appreciate Deputy Count Attorney's Juan Martinez and appreciate the outpouring of support they have received from the public. 'Without the public's support, it would have been impossible for the family to attend trial over the past many years while the case worked its way through the justice system. 'The siblings request that their privacy be respected. They will not be making any further statements or participate in any interviews at this time.' The controversial decision came after jurors deliberated for five days over the 2008 murder which Arias was found guilty of in 2013. Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, was found guilty of the murder in 2013, but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty. Prosecutors accuse Arias of murdering her ex-partner, Travis Alexander, in a jealous rage, but she says she acted in self-defense. Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home. He had been stabbed multiple times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face. In closing statements, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi called for Arias' life to be spared, describing her as a remorseful and mentally ill woman who had been abused since childhood. Prosecutor Juan Martinez accused Arias of acting in a cold and calculating way and said there were no factors preventing the jury from giving her the death penalty. On Tuesday, the jury of eight women and four men were told by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens to try harder to come to a decision, after apparently deadlocking. Arias decided not to plead her case directly to the jury at the end of the sentencing retrial after Stephens denied the defendant's request that the courtroom be closed to the public and media during her comments. The original trial in 2013 was broadcast live and drew a large audience with its gruesome crime scene photographs and sexually explicit testimony. Grief stricken:Sorenson cries as she leaves the court house with family and friends on Thursday in Phoenix . Tears for her brother: Family members of victim Travis Alexander wept when the judge said jurors couldn't reach a decision. They sobbed as they left the courtroom . New home: This is the exact bed that Jodi Arias will now be transferred to at Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear . Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear: This will be Jodi Arias' new home . Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander . On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial. Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court. Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors. If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander. A judge declared a mistrial Thursday in the Jodi Arias sentencing case after a jury deadlocked on whether the convicted murderer should be executed or sent to prison for life for killing her lover in 2008. Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'. 'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said. Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument. Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim. He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation.",

        "input_text": "A top policeman told his officers to ‘go away and gather evidence’ so they could blame drunken fans for the Hillsborough disaster, a court has heard. Former inspector Clive Davis claimed police were ordered to look for beer cans by the side of a motorway and talk to locals, off licence owners and pub landlords about the behaviour of Liverpool supporters at a ‘call to arms’ meeting of top brass just two days after the tragedy. He said Chief Superintendent Terry Wain, who lead the briefing at the headquarters of South Yorkshire police, told his officers: ‘We are going to put the blame for this disaster where it belongs: on the drunken, ticketless Liverpool fans.’ Ninety-six Liverpool fans died from the crush at the Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest got under way . Mr Davis, who was giving evidence at the new inquests into the deaths of 96 Liverpool supporters, later took part in a Panorama programme for the BBC in which he likened the culture of the force in April 1989 to a ‘Tudor Court.’ The hearing was told that Chief Constable Peter Wright was a strict disciplinarian, an all-powerful Henry VIII figure, running his own ‘Wolf Hall’ where mistakes were never admitted or allowed to enter the public domain. Mr Davis said Mr Wright could make or break careers – helping further the prospects of those who did his bidding and stifling the development of those he didn’t approve of. He said there was no doubt Chief Superintendent Wain, whose briefing he described as the start of the police ‘fight-back,’ was acting on the orders of Chief Constable Wright and had been simply ‘given a job to do.’ Former inspector Clive Davis claimed police were ordered to look for beer cans by the side of a motorway in the days after the tragedy . Mr Davis said he was told by his boss to attend the meeting, on the Monday morning after the abandoned FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, because it would be a good way to get noticed ‘career-wise.’ He said Chief Inspector Norman Bettison, who was his superior, told him the disaster was ‘the biggest thing to happen in South Yorkshire Police’ and it would benefit them ‘to be a part of what was going to happen in the wake of it.’ The inquest heard that then Chief Inspector Norman Bettison, pictured said the disaster was ‘the biggest thing to happen in South Yorkshire Police’ But the jury were told that senior officers disputed that the meeting, on April 17 1989, ever took place. No documents or minutes of the ‘jaw-dropping’ briefing, supposedly held on the fifth floor of South Yorkshire police headquarters, in Sheffield, have ever been found. Mr Davis, who retired from the force in 2006, admitted he kept quiet about the meeting because he would have \"become the problem’ and forced to leave his job. But after hearing senior officers continue to blame fans, following the publication of Hillsborough Independent Panel report in September 2012, he finally decided to act. Mr Davis said he contacted relatives of those who died via the Hillsborough Family Support Group and also agreed to talk about the meeting for a BBC Panorama programme the following year. Referring to what he heard at the briefing, on April 17 1989, Mr Davis said he was left ‘more perplexed’ than ‘outraged’ because it seemed very early to come to a ‘decisive, definitive conclusion’ about what had happened. Cross-examined by Chris Daw QC, representing retired Chief Superintendents Terry Wain and Donald Denton, Mr Davis was accused of telling ‘bare-faced lies.’ But he remained adamant the meeting happened and that he had no problem saying so on oath. The hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "input_text": "It is probably one of the most peculiar aspects of human biology - that females of a certain age lose the ability to reproduce. Now scientists have discovered that killer whales - a species separated from humans by almost 94 million years of evolution - also suffer from the menopause and it could provide clues as to why it evolved in the first place. There is just one other species in the wild known to undergo the menopause - short-finned pilot whales - although it has been observed in a handful of captive primates and animals. Older female killer whales tend to take the lead (like the one above) when families are foraging for food . The evolution of a trait that reduces the reproductive capability of a species has long baffled biologists and there are a number of theories for why it emerged in humans. Now a team of researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of York may have unraveled the reason for the menopause - in killer whales at least. It happens to every woman who reaches a certain age, but in the animal kingdom, the menopause is a relatively uncommon trait. Humans can live long after they stop being able to reproduce, but most animals tend to remain fertile up until they die. A few species of primate, like rhesus monkeys, orangutans and chimpanzees are also known to experience menopause while it has also been reported in elephants and short-finned pilot whales. Laboratory rats, captive opossums and budgerigars have also been observed to under go the menopause. However, the short-finned pilot whale and the killer whale are the only animals that been been seen to live long past the age that they lose the ability to reproduce. They have found that it frees up the older, more experienced females to lead their families in the search for food and so boost the ability of the entire group to survive. The findings may now also help to explain why the menopause emerged in human populations - it allowed older women to impart their knowledge and help care for the younger members. Professor Darren Croft, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Exeter, said: 'In humans, it has been suggested that menopause is simply an artifact of modern medicine and improved living conditions. 'However, mounting evidence suggests that menopause in humans is adaptive. 'In hunter-gatherers, one way that menopausal women help their relatives, and thus increase the transmission of their own genes, is by sharing food. 'Menopausal women may also have shared another key commodity - information.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Current Biology, studied groups of killer whales in the wild off the coast of British Columbia and Washington during nine summer salmon migrations. Female killer whales can continue having calves, like above, until around the age of 35 years old say scientists . In total they observed 102 whales - 58 of which were female - and studied which of the whales occupied the lead position as the whales hunted for the salmon. They also used 35 years worth of data on the whale population in the area to identify those that had gone through the menopause. On average female killer whales older than 35 years old were found to have gone through the menopause. The researchers found that the older post-reproductive females tended to lead groups of the whales when they were foraging for salmon. Orca are one of just two species that are known to undergo the menopause in the wild other than humans . They were also more likely to take the lead in years when the salmon abundance was low - meaning the killer whales were struggling to find food. This is because the older females are using their greater experience to help the group find food, say the researchers. Dr Lauren Brent, a behavioural biologist at the University of Exeter who was the lead author of the research, said: Our results show that postreproductive females may boost the fitness of kin through the transfer of ecological knowledge. 'The value gained from the wisdom of elders can help explain why female killer whales and humans continue to live long after they have stopped reproducing. The researchers also found that post-menopausal killer whales were also more likely to lead their sons than their daughters. Dr Daniel Franks, from the University of York, said: 'Killer whale mothers direct more help toward sons than daughters because sons offer greater potential benefits for her to pass on her genes. 'Sons have a higher reproductive potential and they mate outside the group, thus their offspring are born into another gruop and do not compete for resources within the mother's matriline.'",

Kieran Carroll, 22, of Luton, Bedfordshire, has 'left' with his eight-month-old son Louis before, a source close to his family told MailOnline this afternoon. It comes as police renewed their appeal for Mr Carroll to get in contact after he posted two messages on Facebook saying both he and his son were 'fine'. Missing: CCTV footage released yesterday by Bedfordshire Police (left) shows the last sighting of Kieran Carroll, 22, from Luton, who has gone missing with his eight-month-old son Louis (right, together) Taunt: This comment, posted in response to a police appeal, is believed to have come from one of three accounts belonging to Mr Carroll. Police said they are now trying to verify the message . In response: Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post yesterday afternoon (seen above) Speaking today, the family source told MailOnline that they did not know what had 'gone on' but said 'it isn't the first he's left with his son.' The source added that they knew both father and son were 'fine'. It is understood the child was in his father's care at the time they were last seen. It is understood that Mr Carroll attended Bedford College, Bedfordshire, and formerly lived with his girlfriend, Louis' mother, at a home in Luton. The 20-year-old woman is believed to have a three-year-old son from a previous relationship. Yesterday afternoon, police searching for Mr Carroll released CCTV footage showing him pushing a pram as he left a hotel in the town at about 2pm. He has not been seen since. When the image was shared on Facebook by Bedfordshire Police, a profile understood to belong to Mr Carroll posted: 'I’m fine, so is my child - go look for some killers'. The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said. Later last night, the same 'Kieran Carroll' profile commented again, saying, 'If any one is commenting and don't no me or what's really going on... stay out of my life you don't no me.' Concerns: Bedfordshire Police also released this photograph of baby Louis, whom they are trying to trace . Detective Inspector Quinn replied to the Facebook post yesterday afternoon, saying: 'Kieran – Thank you for posting on our Facebook page. ‘We are pleased to hear that you and Louis are safe. It is not the role of the police to decide on child custody matters. The baby's great-grandmother today appealed for Mr Carroll to bring Louis back home safely. Vivien Jakob-Grant, 65, told ITV Anglia: 'I would rather Louis be back home where he should be. I want him to be back home in one piece. 'I don't think his father would have hurt him because he doesn't look the kind of person who would do that - but I want him to be back home. 'I would just like him to take Louis back home where he should be.' ‘All we need to do is see you and Louis in person to check you are safe and well. Please call us on 101 so we can arrange to meet you. We cannot close this case until we see you.' Police are now trying to verify the Facebook comments believed to have been posted by Mr Carroll. Today, officers renewed their appeal, asking Mr Carroll to contact them directly. Detective Inspector Sean Quinn said this afternoon: 'We don’t believe that there are any issues with Kieran providing care for Louis but we do still need Kieran to get in touch with us. 'He is not in any trouble for taking Louis but I would still like to speak to him. We cannot close the case until the police have seen Louis. 'Louis’s mother is understandably worried and missing her son so again I’d urge Kieran, or anyone who knows where Kieran is, to call us on 101.' The posts on the Bedfordshire Police Facebook page prompted a number of comments from Mr Carroll's friends and family, defending his actions. Search: Fears are growing because police say the disappearance of Mr Carroll (above) is ‘completely out of character’, and because they believe he does not have any supplies for the baby . One commenter on the Facebook page, Chantelle Louise White, said: ‘You lot make out that he ant fine I know him for years and he won't do nuttin to he's son… He's looked after my son when he was the sane age! [sic]’ And Mr Carroll's sister, Alix Carroll, 24, said: 'My brother is an amazing father - he has his boy more than the mother does. A close friend of Mr Carroll last night claimed the father and Louis were ‘safe’. She said he was not planning to contact police 'yet' because he does not want to lose contact with Louis. Speaking last night, the woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I just spoke to him on the phone and I heard his child giggling in the background. 'He is just trying to do the right thing but he has done it the wrong way. I have told him that. He is trying to take back his child from his mother. 'Kieran is doing the right thing by taking the child out of this situation and he is not going to the police just yet. I am trying to convince him but I can't force him to do it. 'He can't bear the fact that tomorrow he won't be able to see his child again because social services will get involved.’ 'He's scared he's going to lose him - it's no different to if it was the other way round. 'Never in a million years would he harm a hair on his body. He will be safe - I bet my life on it.' Posting on Facebook, she added that she didn't know where her brother was, but that 'Louie is safe and there both okay [sic].' Earlier, police described the father’s disappearance as ‘completely out of character’ and said there are concerns because they believe Mr Carroll does not have any supplies for the baby. Mr Quinn said: 'This type of disappearance is very out of character for Kieran and we are becoming increasingly concerned. 'We just want Kieran to contact us to let us know that him and Louis are safe. 'If you have seen Kieran, or have any information about where he and Louis may be, please contact us immediately.' Mr Carroll is described as a white man of medium build, with short brown hair. He is believed to be wearing black trousers, and a grey hooded top, a bobble hat, as seen in the CCTV image. He also has tattoos on his arms. The security image shows Mr Carroll pushing a pram, but police said he later disposed of the pram at a friend's house and left carrying his son in his arms. The baby boy is believed to be wearing a blue cardigan with a picture of a ship on it. Searches for the young father are concentrating on the local area around his home of Luton. Anyone who may have seen Mr Carroll and his son, or has any information on their whereabouts, is urged to contact Mr Quinn on 101.",

Enough members of the president's party have signaled support for that bill and another that would impose new sanctions on Iran if it doesn't make an agreement with negotiators that the White House would be powerless to stop the measures from going into effect once passed. The Obama administration and its international partners now have until March 24 to set up the framework for a deal. Scroll down for video . Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, a Republican, center, is flanked by the committee's ranking member, Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, right, and Sen. James Risch, a Republican, as they listen to Secretary of State John Kerry, center, back to camera, testify on Capitol Hill last week. Corker and Menendez are the chief sponsors of one of the bills that would restrict the executive branch's negotiating authority . After that, a dozen Democratic senators, including Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs committee, have said they will join with the GOP majority to pass bills inserting themselves into the process. One would levy additional sanctions on Iran after June 30 if it doesn't agree to the final terms of a deal, though monthly waivers would be allowed should more time be requested. The other would give the Senate the power to reject within 60 days any pact the executive branch makes with Iran. Democrats who spoke with Politico voiced their displeasure with the 47 GOP senators who wrote a letter to Iran notifying the country's leaders that any contract it makes with the Obama administration would be nullified when a new president takes office in January 2017, whereas most members of the upper chamber would be in office for years to come. But that hasn't changed their position on the core issue, they've said. 'The letter’s incredibly unfortunate and inappropriate,' Heitkamp said.'That doesn’t diminish my support for the legislation that we introduced.' Michigan Sen. Gary Peters similarly said the missive was 'simply unacceptable' and 'brought hyperpartisanship to an issue that we need to maintain our bipartisanship in.' He added: 'That doesn’t change my support for that bill. … I stay firm.' Blumenthal last week called Republicans' actions 'unconscionable' and bemoaned them for disrespecting the president. At the time, he said the bipartisan coalition of senators willing to buck the White House was 'in tatters.' Blumenthal told CNN that he was determined to 'stitch it back together,' though. A week later it appeared that the group was holding strong and that Senate Foreign Relations Bob Corker, one of just seven Republican senators who did not sign the 'open letter,' was correct in predicting last Thursday that the whole thing would blow over. 'Let a couple days go by. We think there’s going to be really ignited momentum,' Corker had told Politico. Nobody’s dropping out. We’ve had reaffirmed commitment.' Democratic senators remain irritated with their GOP colleagues who last week sent a letter to Iranian leaders, but they will still back bipartisan legislation that would give Congress final say over a nuclear deal. Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, pictured here last Wednesday on Capitol Hill, authored the missive to Tehran . Meanwhile, Republicans who did sign the letter triumphantly declared on the Sunday news shows that they had no 'regrets' about sending Tehran the strongly worded message. 'I stand by the letter,' National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rodger Wicker said on NBC's Meet the Press. 'I think it's interesting that we've had so much talk about process, just like we've had talk about process with Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech, rather than dealing with the substance,' the Mississippi Republican asserted, referring to House Republican leadership's end run around the White House earlier this year when it invited Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told CNN he thinks it was 'fair' for Republicans to explain that Congress will be involved in the process one way or another. 'I don’t think it was a mistake,' he said of the message to Tehran. 'The administration would like to have a distraction, but the point is the subject of the matter,' the GOP leader said. 'Apparently, the Obama administration is on the cusp of entering into a very bad deal with one of the worst regimes in the world.' Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, the author of the GOP letter, said on CBS' Face the Nation that 'Iran’s leaders needed to hear the message loud and clear.' 'I can tell you they are not hearing the message from Geneva,' he told show host Bob Schieffer. Secretary of State John Kerry, who has primarily led talks with Tehran on behalf of the U.S., lambasted letter signers on Sunday, saying, 'I’ve never seen anything like this.' Kerry, a former Massachusetts senator, warned that negotiations would likely extend beyond the end of the month. 'We believe very much that there’s not going to be anything that’s going to change in April or May or June that suggests that a decision you can’t make now will be made then,' he said in a separate appearance on Face the Nation. Secretary of State John Kerry, who has primarily led talks with Tehran on behalf of the U.S., warned Sunday that negotiations would likely extend beyond Democrats' deadline for an agreement framework- March 24 . The White House has threatened to veto Senate legislation interfering with the administration's attempt to convince Tehran to put aside its nuclear ambitions. Obama's chief of staff Denis McDonough again told Corker, a sponsor of the 60-day review bill along with predecessor Menendez, in a Saturday note that the president would not sign legislation usurping his ability to unilaterally approve these types of agreements with foreign governments. McDonough said in the letter to Corker that the White House has 'welcomed Congress’ important role' in talks before essentially instructing the legislative branch to butt out. The Corker-Menendez legislation 'goes well beyond ensuring that Congress has a role to play in any deal with Iran,' McDonough contended, and could set a 'potentially damaging precedent.' On Monday, the White House reiterated its stance that Congress has thoroughly been consulted during negotiations and vowed to continue involving the legislature when the time comes to talk about removing sanctions on Iran. Claims to the contrary are 'baloney,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said, . Earnest said that legislation giving Congress 60 days to reject a deal would suggest to the Iranians that the United States may not stick to its end of the bargain. 'We can't have a situation where you have people in the Congress back seat driving,' the Obama administration official said. If Democrats and Republicans in the Senate stick together, the White House will not be able undo their work. Supporters of the bills now number in the mid 60s. A vote of 66 lawmakers or more in favor of the measures would tie the president's hands. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said Sunday it was 'unrealistic' for the White House to think that Congress wouldn't have a say in any dealings with Iran, however. 'I have supported the negotiations to this point, but any deal that touches upon the congressional statutory sanctions is gonna get a review of Congress, and the only question is are you going to have a constructive, deliberate bipartisan process, or are you going to be rushed and partisan,' he said on Meet the Press.",

Utility workers dispatched in August found 'dangerous gas line connections' after a Con Edison worker reading gas meters smelled gas, according to a Con Edison spokesman. The worker smelled gas on August 6 in the basement of the building that exploded at 121 Second Avenue on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Photographs show the three buildings that entirely collapsed following the East Village explosion last week . Firefighters kept blasting water at pockets of flames among the rubble on Friday as it continued to smoulder . Cars were flattened by the debris as the three buildings collapsed overnight following the explosion . When they were at the building in August, the utility workers found 'multiple leaks' in hoses that were connected to the gas line, the New York Times reported. The company spokesman said Con Edison shut off the building's gas for about ten days, until it was determined to be safe. The owner of Sushi Park, the restaurant where the explosion occurred, told the  Times that utility workers determined that gas intended for his restaurant was being siphoned off illegally for use in newly-renovated apartments upstairs. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday that the blast was possibly tied to someone 'inappropriately' tapping into a gas line. An hour before the blast, Con Edison utility inspectors had been at the scene and determined that pre-existing work was not satisfactory, but the problems were not safety related, the mayor said. A general contractor who went to check out the gas leak report as Sushi Park was one of 50 people arrested in February in a sweep of the city by building and housing inspectors. Dilber Kukic was accused of bribing an undercover investigator to dismiss violations at two properties, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said. He is hospitalized and could not be reached for comment. In all 11 buildings were evacuated after the blast, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay . New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said it could take up to a week for rubble to be cleared from the explosion site . Firefighters have gone through the rubble but Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Luconare, 26, are stil missing . Twenty-two people were injured - four critically - and Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Lucon, 26, remain unaccounted for after the explosion. On Saturday, rescue crews with cadaver dogs clawed through smoldering rubble in the search for Figueroa and Lucon. Authorities said it could take a week of careful digging through twisted debris, bricks and splintered wood before the basement is reached. In all 11 buildings were evacuated, leaving residents of 144 apartments needing places to stay. Con-Ed said they may return to their homes as soon as Sunday. The Manhattan district attorney's office and the NYC Department of Investigation are looking into whether gas and plumbing work being done privately in one building led to the explosion.

But no one was willing to buy the luxurious Sydney apartment where Simon Gittany threw his fiancée fifteen floors to her death when it went to auction on Tuesday. There was only one registered bidder for the two-bedroom property at 1503/157 Liverpool Street in Sydney, which was expected to sell for at least $2 million, despite estate agency Morton & Morton receiving plenty of interest, according to News Corp. Gittany was found guilty of murdering Lisa Cecilia Harnum at the site and was sentenced to 26 years in prison in November 2013 in one of the most high-profile court cases in recent history. On July 30 2011, he threw the former ballerina to her death from the 15th storey apartment. Her fiancé, 40-year-old Gittany, claimed it was suicide and that he had tried to save her life.

Mere seconds after dragging Ms Harnum out of the lift, she was thrown over the side of the building. Gittany took a minute to put on a shirt and then took the lift downstairs. CCTV footage captured these moments as he threw his hands in the air and ran them through his hair . Ms Harnum plunged to her death on the corner of Liverpool and Elizabeth streets in Sydney's city, out the front of the complex 'The Hyde' Just over a year after Gittany was sentenced, the apartment he had been renting with his victim was placed on the market,Fairfax reports. The balcony was used as one of the unit's key selling points. 'The private covered balcony offers a superb entertaining area from which to enjoy the peaceful and unique outlook,' the advert reads. The crime was not mentioned in the advertisement on the Morton & Morton website. However, the property's contract stated: 'The vendor discloses a criminal homicide occurred from the balcony of the property in July 2011 when a previous tenant occupied the property.' Real estate agent Tolga Ozer reportedly mentioned Ms Harnum's death with one of the prospective buyers during an inspection on Saturday, according to SMH. 'I have to inform you of an incident that occurred in this apartment... a girl fell or was thrown and hit the floor,' Tolga Ozer said according to Fairfax. An image of the balcony which was tendered as evidence during the three week trial into Ms Harnum's death . The property where those chilling crime took place was expected to fetch more than $2 million when it went to auction on Tuesday, with the balcony used as one of the unit's key selling points . On July 30 2011 the former ballerina was thrown to her death from the 15th storey apartment. Her fiance, 40-year-old Gittany, claimed it was suicide and that he had tried to save her life . The property was given a glowing description, promising the ultimate luxurious lifestyle. 'Prestige at The Hyde - watch the world go by in style,' reads the advert . The property was given a glowing description, promising the ultimate luxurious lifestyle. 'Prestige at The Hyde - watch the world go by in style,' reads the advert. The two bedroom apartment in the heart of the city is lauded for its 'stunning outlook above the tree-tops of Hyde Park, St Marys Cathedral and beyond to dazzling Sydney harbour.' Apartment 1503 is described as being 'highly coveted'. It towers over Hyde Park, on the corner of bustling Elizabeth and Liverpool streets in Sydney's city. The unit was last sold for $1.6 million in June 2010. Gittany rented the property until he was taken into custody. Images of the property's interior and the exterior have frequently been displayed by the media and in evidence tendered in court during the three week trial. Gittany tried to claim that Ms Harnum committed suicide and he had been unable to save her in her final moments. The judge rejected this . Mr Gittany claimed that when he pulled his fiancée back into the apartment she sat on the couch and he started to make tea in the kitchen (far right) to calm her down. He claimed Lisa then leapt up and ran to the balcony . Mr Gittany claimed that after the lift, he went to the kitchen to make tea for Lisa. He maintains that she jumped up and ran to the balcony. He claimed she jumped to her death before he could save her. The court rejected him claims . Former tenant, 40 year old Gittany, will spend at least 18 years in prison for Ms Harnum's death, making him eligible for parole in 2033. It was ruled that Gittany became 'apoplectic with rage' when his fiancée tried to leave him. She had a one-way ticket booked to return to her family in Canada and escape their controlling relationship. Gittany found Miss Harnum had packed her bags and made enraged threats, according to Judge Lucy McCallum. 'I have no hesitation accepting evidence of…rage,' said Judge McCallum. Mere seconds before Ms Harnum toppled to her death she ran to the lift, trying to flee. CCTV footage in the lift captured the distressing moment Gittany dragged his fiancee out of the lift by her neck. The horrific images show him pulling Ms Harnum back into the apartment with his hand clamped over her mouth to muffle her screams. Residents in the building told the court that they heard Ms Harnum banging on a neighbour's door, shouting: 'Please help me, help me, God help me.' The agent pointed out the luxury apartments 'well-appointed and stylish main bathroom, as well as internal laundry, ample storage and reverse cycle air con' Morton & Morton point out that resident's have a 25 metre infinity pool, gymnasium, spa and sauna . The court accepted the prosecution's version of events, in which Gittany rendered Ms Harnum unconscious in the apartment after dragging her in from the lift.

The court accepted the prosecution's version of events, in which Gittany rendered Ms Harnum unconscious in the apartment after dragging her in from the lift. He then threw her off the balcony to her death. Gittany, pleaded not guilty to murdering Miss Harnum, claiming he was trying to save her from suicide. He had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto the balcony but had failed to stop her falling. The judge did not believe Gittany's account of how Miss Harnum fell to her death, ruling that she 'found him unconvincing'. She said Ms Harnum could not have behaved in the way Gittany said she had - clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints. She said it was likely that Miss Harnum was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death.

Kevin Fleming, 20, and his friend were allegedly picked up in Baltimore, Maryland, by another man on Sunday night and driven to a hotel in Howard County, where they were said to have 'partied'. But the following morning, the unidentified driver woke up alone and discovered both the men and his Ford Escape SUV had gone, sources told ABC. He reported his vehicle stolen to county police. Shortly after, Fleming and his friend allegedly drove the SUV onto the grounds of the NSA and refused police commands to halt. They were subsequently shot by a guard outside the facility. Scroll down for videos . An NSA officer opened fire, killing one of the suspects and wounding a second during a shootout. A white sheet appears to cover a body outside the the SUV . The 44-year-old officer is pictured here being loaded into an ambulance following the harrowing shootout at one of the nation's most secure military installations . What appears to be a brown wig (circled, lower right) can be seen outside the stolen Ford SUV that the suspects were driving. The men were reportedly disguised as women . Fleming's friend, who is yet to be identified, was killed in shooting, the NSA said in a statement. Fleming was flown to hospital with serious injuries, while a NSA police officer was also wounded. It is unclear how the men ended up at the government building. The incident sparked terrorism fears at the heavily secured area on Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, on Monday morning. On Monday afternoon, authorities said that at Fleming and his friend were suspected robbers who were fleeing the scene of a carjacking nearby when they took a wrong turn off a highway. The men then panicked and refused police commands to stop when they strayed on to the highly secretive government property, police said. They were apparently warned several times to halt. When the SUV accelerated, the guard opened fire - killing one passenger and gravely wounding Fleming. The vehicle slammed into a police SUV blocking the road, injuring the officer, as well. The Washington Post reported that the shooting - which resulted in the president being briefed - was linked to the robbery at the Jessup hotel in the morning, less than five miles from the NSA. The NSA checkpoint where the shooting occurred is directly off the busy Highway 295 between Washington, DC, and Baltimore . This diagram shows where the shooting took place - just outside a gate at Fort Meade in Maryland . After stealing the SUV from outside the unidentified hotel, the suspects fled down Highway 295, the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and ended up on Fort Meade, it is reported. As they drove through the gate of the NSA, they accelerated and would not stop, according to the NSA. As they sped through the checkpoint, they slammed into a police SUV. The officer who opened fire was injured in the process. During a later police search of the stolen black Ford, drugs and at least one gun were found in the vehicle, authorities said. It is unknown why the suspects were dressed as women, nor whether their attire was a disguise related to the alleged carjacking or something to with the 'partying' they had apparently done. The 44-year-old NSA police officer and the surviving suspect, 20, were both transported to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore,WTTG-TV reports. Chaos: A black Ford Escape SUV tried to ram through a secure gate near the NSA headquarters on Fort Meade in Maryland about 9am on Monday . A US official told NBC News that the incident appears to be a criminal matter, rather than an act of terrorism . Aerial footage from WRC-TV showed the injured officer being loaded into an ambulance. Other pictures from the scene show what appears to be a crash between the black Ford Escape and a police SUV outside the gates to the military post. A  body can be seen covered by a white sheet next to the black SUV. What appears to be a curly brown wig can be seen beside the SUV, as well . Fort Meade is home to several highly sensitive government agencies, including the NSA - the spy agency responsible for controversial mass surveillance programs - and the US military Cyber Command, which is responsible for military cyber-warfare and defense.

        "input_text": "The missing Philae space probe that bumped down onto the surface of a comet 284 million miles from Earth could wake up from today. Scientists at the European Space Agency have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet 67p/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. They lost contact with the washing-machine sized spacecraft in November last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff. Starved of the sunlight it needed to power its suite of experiments, the lander's batteries went flat after around just 60 hours on the surface. ESA scientists have renewed efforts to contact the Philae lander on Comet 67p, shown in the illustration above . However, as the comet has travelled closer to the sun in its journey through the solar system, researchers hope Philae will get enough light to come back to life. The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. The European Space Agency has now turned on the communication unit on the Rosetta spacecraft that is orbiting the comet. Stephen Ulamec, lander project manager at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), said: 'Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year. 'It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.' Comet 67p is now 186 million miles (300 million km) from the sun. Scientists hope that as the comet rotates and gets closer to the sun, Philae's solar panels will move out of the shade of the cliff it is resting under. Philae touched down on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November, but rather than landing softly, the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice. It first bounced to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then 65ft (20 metres) before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground. Blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air. Scientists described the comet's surface as being more like a trampoline, causing the probe to rebound so far. It is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site. The Rosetta orbiter took a number of images of Philae as it bounced, with its final suspected resting place in the top right. However, further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe . The duck-shaped comet 67p/Churyumove-Geraismenko is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does . This image sent back by the Philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face . Scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership Rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe. Philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander. Before its batteries finally ran out, Philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images. Among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet's surface appears to be made of a very hard 'sintered' ice. This graphic shows how Philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet . Researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life. From several miles above the comet, Rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived. But there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander's solar panels. This would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board. The image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the Rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the Philea lander . Comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in August this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander. Philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least -45 degrees C before it can wake up. It will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up. Once awake, Philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the Rosetta orbiter. Koen Guerts, part of the Philae lander team at the DLR Control Centre, said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home. He said: 'Philae is designed so that, since November 2014, it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up.' 'At this time, we do not yet know that the lander is awake.To send us an answer, Philae must also turn its transmitter – and that requires additional power.' This blurry image captures the moment Philae bounced from the comet's surface after failing to anchor itself . Rosetta captured a mothership's view of Philae as it descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface . Philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication. Over the next eight days the Rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 flybys. Engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to optimise the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with Earth. Once Philae wakes up and can also transmit, it will first send data about its 'health' to Earth. The scientific work with the 10 instruments on board Philae also depends on these results. If sufficient energy cannot be stored in the battery, the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed. Currently, scientists believe that Philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys. Mr Ulamec added: 'Once we can communicate with Philae again, the scientific work can begin.'",

A mechanic who lived a calm, quiet life with his elderly parents was all the time living a secret double life as a sex attacker. Clive Howard, 56, of Suffolk, has admitted carrying out a string of rapes and kidnaps of women during a 28 year period. The serial rapist confessed to the crimes after he was caught after raping a woman at a car park in Norwich when his number plate was recorded on CCTV. But police fear he may have carried out even more attacks across three different counties and have appealed for any victims to come forward. Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess, of Norfolk Police rape investigation unit said: 'Cases like this don't come up very often - we're talking about a serial rapist. 'We want to give people the chance to come forward.' Howard, who lived a double life with his parents, had initially denied the rape in Norwich but changed his plea on the day of his trial. At a hearing at Norwich Crown Court he admitted seven counts of rape, three charges of attempted kidnap and one count of attempted rape, between 1986 and 2014. Howard, of Battisford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was caught by police after he attacked a woman in St Helens Wharf car park, Norwich, on May 30 2014. The victim, in her 20s, was walking home after a night out when she was given a lift by Howard, who then raped her. She tried to take a picture of the car's registration number but Howard grabbed her phone and hurled it into a bush before he sped off.  The woman found it before dialling 999. Police were able to get part of the car's number plate from CCTV - and that led them straight to Howard, the registered owner. He was arrested and charged a few days later. Det Sgt Burgess said Howard had done 'two to three loops' around the city 'before he managed to pick his victim'. After he was charged Howard's DNA was put into the national police database which raised an unsolved case in Cambridgeshire in 2013. Howard was caught after part of his Volvo number plate was captured on CCTV after he raped a woman . Howard's number plate was recorded after he parked at St Helens Wharf in Norwich and raped the woman . Detectives found 'striking similarities' to the Norwich assault. Howard's DNA matched a profile obtained during an investigation into the attempted kidnap of a woman in her 20s on May 5, 2013 in Cambridge park Christ's Pieces. The woman managed to fend off Howard, scratching him in the process, and DNA was later retrieved from underneath her fingernail. He was linked to three other attempted kidnappings in Cambridge, one of which happened just 30 minutes before he struck in Christ's Pieces. Howard also tried to abduct two women in the city on February 15, 2014, during the night. Det Sgt Burgess said: 'All were in the early hours of the morning. 'Each of the women were approached by a man who had got out of a car and attempted to get them into it.' He lived a double life with his parents as a mechanic but carried out a string of rapes and attempted kidnaps . He added: 'I'm concerned there are other victims out there either in Norfolk, Suffolk or Cambridge and would urge other women to come forward. 'It's very rare.' As well as the rape in Norwich, Howard also admitted six counts of rape against a woman between November 1986 and March 1993. Howard, who is understood to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the court on April 20. Judge Stephen Holt told him: 'You've pleaded guilty and the one thing that can be said is your victim has been spared the ordeal of giving evidence. 'I'm sure you will understand I need to have a full pre-sentence report and the whole issue of whether you need to be sentenced as a dangerous offender will be made.' Det Sgt Burgess said: 'Reliving an experience such as this is never easy for a victim of sexual assault. 'I recognise the bravery shown by all victims in this case who would have been prepared to give evidence, had the case gone to trial. 'Howard's guilty plea demonstrates the strong case police had against him and I believe women are safer with this dangerous man off the streets,' he said. 'A striking similarity between the cases is that Howard would prey on women walking alone at night. 'I hope his guilty plea goes some way to helping his victims move forward from this terrible experience.' Howard was a respectable garage mechanic who didn't have a criminal record and lived an extraordinary double life with his elderly parents in Battisford. He also had his own house in nearby Stowmarket. He is thought to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend but was 'actively seeking sexual partners' on internet dating sites.",

        "input_text": "It took just one juror to spare the life of convicted murderer Jodi Arias on Thursday - and the woman had to survive an attempt by her colleagues to boot her from the jury before she could do it. In the end, the jury voted 11-1 in favor of death - but not enough to send Arias to death row in the case that became a global sensation with its tawdry revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. The deadlock took the death penalty off the table and left a judge to decide whether to sentence Arias to life in prison or to life with the possibility of release after 25 years. That decision is expected at an April 13 hearing. Arias was convicted in 2013 of killing her lover, 30-year-old Travis Alexander, but that jury also deadlocked on her punishment, prompting the sentencing retrial that began in October. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Convicted killer Jodi Arias (pictured in court on Thursday) was spared execution by the vote of one juror who voted against the death penalty . Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . The holdout juror did not speak to the media on Thursday. But other jurors said they thought Arias lacked remorse and that her attorneys had presented an inaccurate portrait of Mr Alexander. The jurors did not elaborate but during the trial, defense lawyers said Alexander had used Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, to quench his sexual urges, called her demeaning names and told her she was soulless. Most of the jurors said they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. The other jurors asked the judge on Tuesday if the woman could be replaced with an alternate, but the request was denied and jury was told to keep deliberating. The one juror who voted against the death penalty for Jodi Arias admitted to having seen the 2013 Lifetime Television movie (pictured) about the convicted killer entitled, Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret . One male juror said on Thursday that he became angry when the holdout indicated the death penalty would be a form of revenge. 'The one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning,' a male juror said according to AZ Central. 'The 11 of us strived for justice, but to no avail,' another juror, who was also not identified, said. 'We absolutely feel the penalty should have been death.' Jurors also note that the woman had acknowledged seeing a 2013 cable TV movie, made by Lifetime Television, about the Arias case, entitled Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret. Jurors apologized to the Alexander family for the deadlock and said they felt Arias was trying to manipulate the jury. None of the jurors would give their names. The identities of jurors are kept secret in Arizona. Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . New home: This is the exact bed that Jodi Arias will now be transferred to at Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear . The jury deliberated for about 26 hours over five days. They said they started with about half of the members voting for the death penalty, eventually reached the 11-1 vote then got stuck. They described having knots in their stomachs and problems sleeping at night during the trial. Arias will begin serving her sentence in a 12-by-7 foot cell in a maximum-security unit at the Perryville prison for women, west of downtown Phoenix. If officials deem her behavior is good over time, she could be moved to a medium security unit. 'Travis Alexander's surviving brothers and sisters Gary Alexander, Dennis 'Greg' Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson, Samantha Alexander, Hillary Wilcox, Steven Alexander and Allie Iglesias are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. 'However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time. They appreciate Deputy Count Attorney's Juan Martinez and appreciate the outpouring of support they have received from the public. 'Without the public's support, it would have been impossible for the family to attend trial over the past many years while the case worked its way through the justice system. 'The siblings request that their privacy be respected. They will not be making any further statements or participate in any interviews at this time.' Nearly $3 million of taxpayer money was spent during both trials. Arias' court-appointed attorneys billed the state for $2.7 million. Prosecutors say they spent more than $132,000 on expert witnesses, transcripts, travel expense and other costs, though that figure doesn't include the salary of the prosecutor. Prosecutors said they don't regret trying again to send Arias to death row. 'Regret is a place in the past I can't afford to live in,' Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said. Alexander's family members wept when the judge announced the deadlock. His distraught sister, Tanisha Sorenson, was overcome with grief and held her face in her hands while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life. Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said: 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' His brothers and sisters said in a statement that they 'are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty, however, we understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time.' Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said the killing was a tragedy and 'no verdict ultimately could repair that sadness'. Prosecutors say Arias killed Alexander as revenge because he wanted to date other women and was planning a trip to Mexico with his latest love interest. Authorities said Arias shot him in the head and stabbed and slashed him nearly 30 times then left his body in his shower at his suburban Phoenix home, where friends found him about five days later. Lumley Unit of the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville near Goodyear: This will be Jodi Arias' new home . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later . During closing arguments in the penalty retrial, prosecutor Juan Martinez repeatedly showed jurors gruesome crime scene photos of the victim's slit throat. The images were a counterpoint to the happy photos of Arias that her attorney displayed in arguing there was more to her life than her actions in the killing. Nurmi told jurors that Arias deserved a second chance because she was the victim of verbal and physical abuse throughout her life. Arias initially courted the spotlight after her arrest, granting interviews to '48 Hours' and 'Inside Edition.' She testified for 18 days at her first trial, describing her abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, relationship with Alexander and her contention that he was physically abusive.",

The passenger, whose identity has not been released, has served years in prison for murder and offenses involving explosives, the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office said as it revealed the 'significant aviation security breach' in a statement on Thursday night. The watchdog was asked to investigate the June 2014 incident last October after a whistleblower came forward. It did not release specific details of the passenger's criminal history or where the incident took place. The passenger, who is a U.S. citizen, had not registered for the TSA's PreCheck program, but if they had, they would have been rejected because of their convictions, the office said in the statement. 'Significant security breach': A passenger who has convictions for murder and offenses involving explosives was allowed to pass through the TSA's PreCheck line (file picture) despite an agent recognizing them . Instead, they were selected for the screening through the Secure Flight program's 'risk assessment rules', the watchdog said. The program compares information the traveler has given their airline with information from the Terrorist Screening Database, No Fly lists and other intelligence-based systems to determine if they can board the plane and to identify low-risk passengers for expedited screening. After determining a passenger can be pre-screened, it allows them to print documents carrying the PreCheck sign. The TSA was unable to show the traveler's vetting results because they are deleted seven days after travel, the Inspector General's Office said. When the passenger reached the airport, an agent looked at their documents. 'After checking the traveler's boarding pass and identification, an alert Transportation Security officer at the airport recognized the felon and alerted his supervisor,' the watchdog said, CNN reported. 'However, the supervisor directed the [officer] to take no action and allow the traveler to continue through the TSA pre-check lane.' As part of the PreCheck system, the passenger - who has a criminal history involving explosives - would not have had to take off their shoes or jackets or remove liquids from their carry-on luggage. Investigation: The TSA responded that all passengers, including those with PreCheck tickets, are subject to 'robust' checks. It is not known where the June 2014 breach took place . The incident was brought to the attention of the Inspector General's Office's after a whistleblower went to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal investigative agency. A classified report was issued to TSA detailing the need to make changes to the PreCheck vetting and screening process. On Thursday, the TSA said in a statement that it 'takes its responsibility for protecting the traveling public very seriously'. 'All passengers, including those with TSA PreCheck on boarding passes, are subject to a robust security approach that employs multiple layers of security, both seen and unseen,' it said. The TSA added that the success of its pre-screening system relies on the intelligence and national law enforcement communities identifying passengers they believe to pose a risk - yet this passenger had not been place on one of their lists. Still, the agency said it was reviewing the guidelines it provides to TSA officers and supervisors to ensure they 'clearly understand the procedure in the event a person or item presents a creditable threat to transportation security'.",
        "summary": "The unidentified passenger had convictions for murder and offenses related to explosives, said Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office .\nDespite this, the traveler was issued a ticket allowing them to take the PreCheck lane .\nA TSA agent recognized the felon and told their supervisor - but the supervisor allowed the passenger to go through anyway .\nPreCheck means passengers can keep on their jackets, do not need to remove shoes and do not need to take liquids out of their luggage .\nThe watchdog, which began investigating in October after a whistleblower came forward, did not say where the June 2014 incident took place .\nTSA said it takes its responsibility to protect the public 'very seriously'"

Slashing £12billion from the nation’s bloated benefits bill will be at the heart of the Tory pitch for a second term in office. George Osborne’s pre-election budget next week will be a ‘steady as you go’ exercise with the emphasis on sustaining growth and reducing the deficit. But the Chancellor is planning to use a section of his speech – kept separate from measures agreed by the Coalition – to highlight proposals to ease the income tax burden. Tory sources say other measures that appear ‘nailed on’ for their election manifesto include: . The measures would help Mr Osborne find the £30billion he needs to erase the budget deficit by the end of the next Parliament in 2019. Treasury officials believe £5billion can be raised from a crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion on top of the £12billion annual welfare saving. The proposals undermine Labour’s claim that the Conservatives will balance the books through apocalyptic Whitehall cuts. The Tories say they will raise the point at which people pay higher rate income tax to £50,000 by the end of the next Parliament – lifting hundreds of thousands of middle class professionals out of the 40p band. Another objective is to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 a year. The Chancellor is also thought to be considering granting pensioners the right to take money out of their retirement funds. The move would be a radical extension of his decision last year to free retirees from having to buy what are often poor-value annuities with their pension savings. Although public borrowing for 2014-15 is expected to come at below the £91billion projected in the autumn statement last December, the Chancellor will have little wriggle room for electoral giveaways. His Liberal Democrat coalition partners are reluctant to allow him to use the Budget as a launch-pad for the Tory election campaign. However, another tax break for millions of workers is expected with a hike in the personal tax allowance, which is already due to rise to £10,600 next month. It is expected that the Chancellor will take the opportunity to announce a full review of the business rates system. Retailers have long been pushing for reform of rates – which have existed in various forms since Tudor times – to ease the pressure on the high street. The proposals undermine Labour’s claim that the Conservatives will balance the books through apocalyptic Whitehall cuts. Above, Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) Sources suggest that moving away from a charge based on the rateable value of a commercial property to a modern alternative – such as a sales tax – is one option. Critics of the existing system say that it is absurd in the internet age to base company taxes on the physical space they occupy. There is speculation that the Chancellor will use his budget to unveil populist measures such as a cut in the duty on beer and wine. Key tax avoidance and evasion measures to be announced by the Chancellor will include an end to ‘umbrella’ arrangements. One scheme – used by collapsed delivery firm City Link – allows companies to escape corporate and national insurance tax by employing their workforce as freelance sub-contractors. 'Google' tax: The HMRC will assess the British turnover of low tax paying companies such as Starbucks and Amazon and will tax them proportionally on the earnings in the UK. Above, file image . Mr Osborne is planning heavy penalties on tax advisers, including the big accounting firms, banks and others that set up and promote tax avoidance scams. Changes in the tax regime will make it unlawful for individuals or companies to raise new debts solely for the purpose of writing off the interest payments on that debt against tax. This technique is widely used by private equity firms. The budget will herald the final closure of the loopholes that allow companies and individuals to hide their tax affairs in secretive overseas jurisdictions. So far more than 90 countries – including Switzerland, Luxembourg and the British crown territories such as the Caymans – have signed up to a convention that requires them to be fully transparent and hand over the details of tax residents to HMRC. Mr Osborne plans full implementation of the so-called ‘Google’ tax.

        "input_text": "The White House is reportedly considering a new power play in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that would paint Benjamin Netanyahu into a corner just days after his stunning come-from-behind victory in his country's hotly contested elections. In the final days of campaigning, Netanyahu vowed in an historic U-turn that his government would never agree to the creation of a Palestinian state. But now President Barack Obama is contemplating using the United Nations as a trump card to force the issue. Under a plan outlined by Foreign Policy magazine, the U.S. State Department would ease away from decades of opposition to a Security Council resolution demanding peace talks and a final rapprochement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The White House cautiously avoided commenting on its future plans on Thursday when it was bombarded with questions by reporters on the topic, saying only that it would 'evaluate what our path is forward' is in light of Netanyahu's comments. NOT SO FAST ... The White House is considering a Netanyahu smackdown in the form on United Nations leverage to force him into breaking a campaign promise about peace with Palestinians . WATCHING AND WAITING: State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the US is evaluating its options – leaving the door open for lifting opposition to a UN two-state solution pushed on Israel . The U.S. and Israeli leaders have a famously chilly relationship. A former top-level Obama campaign aide helped organize voters aligned with Netanyahu's political opposition – even as the president refused to meet with Netanyahu this month, saying he didn't want to influence the election's outcome. The Obama administration hoped to see Netanyahu's left-wing rival, Isaac Herzog, prevail on Tuesday. Diplomats at the UN privately learned in the run-up to Election Day that the U.S. would not press the UN Security Council on peace talks if Herzog were to win, since he would likely have carried the ball on his own. But with Netanyahu poised to organize a coalition government comprised of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties opposed to a Palestinian state, all bets are off. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday that 'we’re currently evaluating our approach. We’re not going to prejudge what we would do if there was a UN action.' The chief spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue reiterated the administration's position on Thursday and made clear that no decisions had been made yet on the United States' part. He also refused to characterize the president's reaction to Netanyahu's victory, stating that, obviously, the president was 'aware' of it when asked by a reporter if Obama was 'disappointed' with the election results. Complicating the situation, the Palestinian Authority says it might take grievances against Israel, stemming from last year's brief Gaza war, to the International Criminal Court. The Palestine Liberation Organization’s top diplomat in the United States explained to Foreign Policy that the PA could formally accuse Israel of committing war crimes when it fired rockets into populated areas in response to sustained attacks. Israel has said it did all it could to avoid casualties among civilians, but insists militants from the Hamas terror group took shelter where collateral damage would be greatest in order to discourage return fire. Turning to the ICC for redress would prove costly for Palestinians, however. The United States provides about $500 million in annual aid to the PA, and $400 million of that is drawn from an Economic Support Fund that members of Congress from both sides of the political aisle have threatened to cut off. The U.S. has paid out approximately $5 billion in aid money to the Palestinian Authority since the 1990s, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service – representing about one in four dollars it receives from the international community. But at the end of January an astonishing 75 out of 100 U.S. senators signed a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry warning that any Palestinian action against Israel in the ICC would be met by a budget axe. The 2015 budget appropriations bill, signed by Obama, explicitly prohibited funding for the PA if it were to initiate – or even actively support – an ICC probe related to war crimes accusations against Israel. BIG CHILL: President Barack Obama has had the frostiest relationship with Israel of any US leader since the 1970s . The senators warned Kerry that Abbas was illegally challenging 'Israel’s legitimate right to defend its citizens and territory.' PA President Mahmoud Abbas officially joined the ICC late last year. In the days following the seating of the new Congress in January – long before Netanyahu notched his surprising re-election win – the State Department seemed to lean toward supporting the Senate. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters then that action in the ICC could have unspecified 'implications' for future U.S.-Palestinian aid. 'Congress has a great deal of power in that regard,' she said. But administration officials are now leaning toward using the United Nations to force Netanyahu into a tricky spot. 'We are signaling that if the Israeli government’s position is no longer to pursue a Palestinian state, we’re going to have to broaden the spectrum of options we pursue going forward,' a U.S. official told Politico. And Jeremy Ben-Ami, who leads the pro-Israel but left-wing group J Street, told the paper that he expects the Obama administration to look very closely at the possibility of either joining, or at least not blocking an internationally backed move at the UN to restate the parameters for ending the [Arab-Israeli] conflict.' White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough's remarks to the group on Monday at its national conference in Washington, D.C. could shed further light on the administration's position. The Israeli election, and the Obama administration's reactions, come against the backdrop of U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear ambitions and Netanyahu's forceful objections that a nuke in Tehran would be an existential threat to Israel. Kerry, America's top diplomat, phoned Netanyahu to congratulate him on his victory, but did so from Switzerland where he was meeting with his Iranian counterpart. President Obama called the Israeli leader Thursday afternoon, the White House said.",
        "summary": "Obama may end US opposition to a UN Security Council resolution designed to force Israel into a two-state solution with Palestinians .\nWhite House is upset that Benjamin Netanyahu was re-elected, especially on the U-turn promise that he wouldn't  agree to a Palestinian state .\nPalestinian Authority threatened to file war crimes charges against Israel in the International Criminal Court, related to rocket attacks last summer .\nUS Congress would cut $400 million in annual aid to the PA is it followed through .\nObama's spokesman refused to characterize the president's reaction to Netanyahu's reelection on Thursday .\nHe would only say that the Israeli PM's comments on Palestine had lead the president and his advisers to 'evaluate what our path is forward'"

Analize Osceola of Hollywood, Florida, called police on Thursday to say that Ahizya Osceola, 3, was missing despite the fact that hours earlier she had found the boy dead and stuffed his heavily bruised body into a trash bag that she then hid inside a Baby Einstein toy box which she put under piles of clothing in her laundry room. She was charged on Wednesday with aggravated manslaughter, child neglect and providing false information to law enforcement. This after an autopsy revealed signs of horrifying abuse. Scroll down for video . It has been revealed that the stepmother of Ahizya Osceola (left), Analize Osceola (right), who stuffed his dead body in a trash bag  then called police and claimed he was missing has been charged in his death . Analize  hid the body in the laundry room of their home (above), where police ultimately found it after growing suspicious . The Sun-Sentinel reports that the boy's father, Nelson Osceola, who had been married to Analize for 10 months, was also charged with child neglect. An autopsy revealed the boy died of blunt impact abdominal trauma. In addition to the bruising all over the boy's body, the boy's pancreas was split in three pieces and the enzymes had begun to break down his internal organs. There was also a spiral fracture on the boy's shin bone from an old break. 'In his first three years of life, he endured what we believe to be a significant amount of pain,' said Hollywood Police Chief Frank Fernandez. 'No child should ever, ever endure this life, the life of little Ahziya.' Earlier this week, Child Protective Services documents obtained by NBC 6 state that Analize woke up at around 4am last Thursday and, according to her claims, she heard the young boy moaning. She then went over and found he was very cold, but still warm, so she gave him CPR. With his pulse weak, she then claims she went to get him some Pedialyte, then decided it was best to try and make him vomit. The boy, she claims, died soon after, and she waited until the other adults were out of the house and then stuffed the boy's dead body in a trash bag and hid it in the laundry room. Throughout this all, Analize's mother had been in the house, who is a nurse. She never told her mother anything about what happened or asked her to help when the boy was in distress.

        "input_text": "Robert Durst's wife has not spoken to him since explosive documentary, The Jinx, aired and is now living with his lawyer, it has been revealed. In the aftermath of the   documentary, which outlined the life of real estate scion Robert Durst and his possible involvement in multiple murders, many wished to know more about his wife of 15 years, Debrah Lee Charatan. Charatan, a self-made real estate executive, was briefly featured in the documentary in a clip from years earlier as she gave testimony to police pertaining to the her husband's murder of Morris Black in Galveston, Texas, but other than that did not participate in the film. Now it has been revealed that Charatan not only advised Durst against participating in the documentary, but also has not spoken to him since it premiered and has been living with his lawyer. This as the final episode featured audio of Durst possibly admitting to committing these murders, saying he 'killed them all' during a moment when the cameras were off but his microphone was still on. Scroll down for videos . Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan is reportedly no longer supporting the millionaire real estate scion and has been living with his lawyer, Steven I. Holm (above) Durst (above) is expected to be charged with first-degree murder in the death of his friend Susan Berman, who was killed on Christmas Eve 2000 . The New York Times writes that Charatan seems to have taken a step back from her husband recently, no longer travelling with him and living with Steven I. Holm, one of his lawyers. Charatan and Holm were even photographed together at a Central Park event in 2010, though the extent of their relationship is not known and Charatan refused requests for comment from the paper. Authorities are now looking to question Charatan as they believe her husband is responsible for murdering his friend Susan Berman on Christmas Eve of 2000, just two weeks after he wed Charatan. The incident occurred shortly after Berman, a lifelong confidant of Durst, contacted the man to let him know that police wished to speak with her regarding the disappearance of his first wife Kathie in 1982, who to this day has never been found. Many believe Durst also knows about the disappearance of his first wife Kathie (above) who was last seen in 1982 . Both Durst and Charatan have previously revealed that they were only married so that she could receive his estate and inheritance should he die, and so the money would not go back into the family business. Durst remained upset that his father Seymour had selected his younger brother Douglas to run the Durst Organization in 1994, and thus did not want the $2million he received every year from a trust to go to the company should he die. 'It was our understanding that unless I was married to him, I couldn’t benefit from any of the trusts,' Charatan said in a deposition while being questioned about the Black incident, in which her husband was ultimately found by a jury to be acting in self defense when he shot the man and then dismembered his body. Because of their marriage however, Charatan cannot be compelled to testify against her husband as he faces possible new charges in the death of Berman, and even if she did, Durst would likely have her testimony blocked. Charatan, who wed Durst (above in his booking photo following his arrest for the Morris Black murder) in 2000, is said to have advised Durst against doing the recent documentary The Jinx . Meanwhile, reports that Charatan could also face aiding and abetting charges stemming from Durst's recent arrest in New Orleans as authorities believe he was trying to flee the country for Cuba, seem to be unfounded as she not only was not speaking to to him at that time but also was not responsible for sending him the $117,000 in cash that arrived shortly after he was taken into police custody on a warrant from Los Angeles County who wished to extradite him and charge him with murder in the death of Berman. That money it seems came from another woman in New York, who sent it to Durst in luggage that was also filled with shoes after he called her upon his arrival in New Orleans. Charatan has never said much about her husband, frequently refusing to comment about the man who she met at a real estate dinner in 1988, and has kept a very low profile in recent weeks as new charges have been brought against him. In addition to the murder charge in California, he also faces charges in New Orleans as he had a gun and sizable amount of marijuana on him at the time of his arrest. When Durst was arrested for murdering Black however, Charatan was the first person he called; handling his money, helping him decide what lawyer to hire and frequently flying to Texas for the trial. And while much has been made of Durst's tragic childhood and his mother's death by suicide when he was just a young boy, Charatan had an equally troubling youth. Her parents both came from Poland having survived the Nazis, her father losing his foot in a landmine explosion and her mother, an orphan, having been taken in and hidden by a Christian family. Charatan worked hard to make herself a success, once noting; 'I knew if I couldn’t be a star, I wouldn’t be happy.' Along the way she made many friends, and more than a few foes, in the industry. Both Durst (above) and Charatan admit that they only wed so she could eventually receive Durst's inheritance, though she also now cannot testify against him in court . Durst was said to be drawn to the fact that she had worked her way up in the male dominated industry, and helped her out financially as she went through a difficult divorce and custody hearing as well as numerous lawsuits from agents who claimed they had not received their promised commission from Charatan. She remains involved in real estate now, having recently taken her $20million share of Durst's $65million settlement from his claims against his family trust, to start a new company with her son, who she reconnected with roughly 10 years ago after not having spoken to the boy for 15 years. They have an investment office in the Union Square section of Manhattan, and Charatan also recently sold the Fifth Avenue apartment Durst helped her to buy in 1997 and the Bridgehampton home the two shared. Durst meanwhile is being held in a psychiatric correctional center outside New Orleans.",

But the now white elephant White Bay Power Station is set to be brought back to life thanks to a $1 billion makeover, with rumours Google has its sights set on it for its Australian headquarters. Built in 1912, the 38,000 square metre site has had a colourful past, and a tour through the ruins is like stepping back more than 100 years - if you can ignore the crumbling walls, eerie industrial equipment and 100 tonnes of bird droppings which covered the floor of the old dance hall. Asbestos-riddled and home to more pigeons than could be counted before Daily Mail Australia was taken through the cavernous building - not to mention the local bat colony - the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority spent nearly $5 million in 2014 to preserve what was still standing. Among the items still standing idle inside are the old lockers used by employees and storage rooms which dot the building, in this throwback to a bygone era. The bathrooms, fitted even before the advent of the First World War, are lined with graffiti now and the paint is peeling off the old ceramic tiles, which have been preserved in almost pristine condition hidden underneath. 'These buildings are so strong, there are no cracks, it will be great when it happens,' archaeologist Dr Wayne Johnson said. 'It is considered a very significant building and any work has to be done with a strict conservation plan but you can see there is a lot of room for everything else. 'The vastness of it, the great cavernous spaces, the machinery, there's nothing quite like this. 'All you see here represents the whole thing from 1912 until it closed in the 1980s. 'There's evidence of the whole history of its function and enough machinery has been kept so you understand what a power station does.' In the 1950s and 1960s, with the White Bay Power Station at its pomp, local swimmers happened across a novel and secret way to keep up their training in the cold winter months. The water, which would be used to bring the temperatures of the boilers down, would then run off through the underground canal and out into the nearby bay - where John Devitt, a 1960 Olympic gold medallist, was one of the first to recognise its benefits. Dr Johnson claims that 'it is like a piece of industrial archaeology, it reads like a book, you look and you know what it did'. Steve Tadic is the security guard and he keeps his precinct under a tight watch. He's spent more than 20 years in charge. 'Eh you, come here and sign the book' he calls out, with absolute authority, to two workmen who arrive and forget to report in. 'It was very dangerous before they did the work, the homeless people were here,' he said. 'It's a vast cavernous building and you just don't see space like this near a major city with so much artefact like machinery still intact,' said archaeologist Dr Wayne Johnson . The view from above. A watch-room, perched high above the work floor is badly amaged and decaying after decades of non-use . Asbestos sheets, broken glass and timber litters the no-go zone at the last remaining power station of its type in New South Wales . A staple of most dining halls in Australia in the past, the pie oven, this one from 1950, is found in the power station's dining room . Peering into the past and the secret of Olympic success. The canal flushing out the water used to cool the systems down would flow into the bay immediately outside the factory, which became a training pool for gold medal winners like John Devitt in the 1960s . Room with a million dollar view. Authorities have boarded up the windows of the disused power station but any extensive redevelopment will reveal a spectacular panorama of Sydney's famous harbour . The train lines into the old power station are still in place where locomotives laden with coal would unload into an underground storage before it was pushed up the conveyor belt (centre) and then fall down into the boiler rooms, pictured at right . The White Bay Power Station supplied most of the energy needed for Sydney's rail and tram system plus pumping electricity back into the main grid when demand was at high levels during winter and holiday periods . The two smoke stacks, which are 'like two beacons' pointing the way into the city of Sydney. It was once a smoke-spewing industrial behemoth overlooking Sydney Harbour, providing power for the city's rail and tram network. Sirocco machinery pictured inside the abandoned power station. The huge fans were developed for use in power stations in the late 1800s . The old boiler houses became a haven for \"cave clan\" urban explorers and graffiti gangs for more than 30 years before the restoration was undertaken and security beefed up . Much of the heavy oak desks and marble work has stood the test of time, including this clerical and reception space inside the original building at the White Bay Power Station . The main foreman's watch-room up above the factory floor in now in a sorry state, with vandals having taken to it as they had to many parts of the site . The White Bay Power Station was built from 1912, finally came on line in 1917 and operated until it was decommissioned in late 1983. It was the longest serving power station of its type. The original control room remains in place . Old bathrooms have been boarded up. The bathrooms are lined with graffiti now and the paint is peeling off the old ceramic tiles . The original entry point of the Power Station . The walls are showing the signs of wear and tear, with the original paintwork falling off . The workers' wash rooms, some items fitted before World War I, have been unused for decades . Asbestos riddled and home to more pigeons that could be counted and the local bat colony, the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority spent nearly $5 million a year ago, to preserve what was left. But holes are still visible throughout the floor . The dance hall has been cleaned up, if not fully restored. Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority officials arrived to find 100 tonnes of bird droppings filling the room . The old stage remains intact inside the dance hall which hasn't seen any entertainment since the 1950s . The band stand in full flow during a Christmas party for the station's workers in the 1950s . Employees enjoying a performance in the dance hall at the White Bay Power Station in Sydney, just three kilometres from the CBD . The communications board too has somehow stood the test of time, a kind of early 20th century ABN . The walk down to the station engineer's office with signage making it clear the process required after hours . 'There's evidence of whole history of its function and enough machinery has been kept so you understand what a power station does. It is like a piece of industrial archaeology, it reads like a book, you look and you know what it did' said Dr Johnson . And how it looked way back when. The factory floor with boilers in full flow and workers keeping a close eye . One upon a time this equipment was providing most of the power for Sydney's train and tram system . The lights of days gone by litter the floors of the remaining boiler rooms . The roof fixed on the main building and dance hall tidied, there is still no access granted to the public, unless you've been taken through the security check and donned the white contamination suit, for concern over lingering levels of asbestos inside. Several sections are still boarded up to keep away the unwanted intruders, still, the most spectacular view of the harbour panorama that once was, is visible through the slats. The communications board too has somehow stood the test of time, set on the wall almost as a kind of early 20th century ABN. Sadly the definitive foreman towers, perched metres above the work-floor, are not so sound, clearly falling apart .. vandalised and struggling with the sands of time. Elsewhere, shattered glass and broken bits of timber need to be negotiated, as do collapsing floors for fear of plunging many metres. A danger zone, which even the city's so-called \"cave-dwellers\" have declared a no-go zone because of its decaying state. 'In 1912, when it was built, there was a certain capacity, and then in the 1920s they had to enlarge it and then the next boiler hall was brought in during the 50s.'

        "input_text": "He has acted opposite Mae West, tripped the light fantastic on The Great White Way and even partied with Rita Hayworth - and now Ryan is sharing his stories about life during the Golden Age of Hollywood. The only problem is that Ryan is a 10-year-old boy from Muskogee, Oklahoma who was born to Baptist parents. The amazing life he describes belongs to actor and Hollywood agent Marty Martin. Ryan says it was his past life. His vast knowledge, vivid recollections and stunningly accurate descriptions of the era have convinced even experts that the young man may have in fact been reincarnated. Scroll down for video . Ryan (above with his mother) a 10-year-old boy from Muskogee, Oklahoma with Baptist parents claims he has been reincarnated and was an actor and agent in a past life . He believes he was Marty Martin (left), who was in the Mae West (right) film Night After Night and performed on Broadway . It all began when Ryan was just 4 years old, his mother Cyndi told Today. She says he began having nightmares that neither she or her husband, a local police officer, could find a way to stop. He would talk about his heart exploding and, more than anything, Hollywood, a place that was thousands of miles away from Oklahoma. What's more, the reserved youngster would always speak in a matter-of-fact manner during these times. Then, after a year of this, he finally sat down his mom. 'He said \"Mom, I have something I need to tell you,\"' said Cyndi. 'I used to be somebody else.' Having been raised Baptist, Cyndi did not believe in reincarnation or past lives, and decided to hide her son's admission from his father. But she slowly became curious and then somewhat convinced the more her son spoke of Hollywood, his five marriages, lavish trips to Europe, his old homes and how all his acting clients kept changing their last names, so she decided to start doing some research on Hollywood during the studio era and shared some of the books she found at the local library with her son. Then, one day, Ryan had a breakthrough when he saw a still from the from the 1932 movie Night After Night starring Mae West. 'That's me,' Ryan told his mother. Ryan began seeing Dr. Jim Tucker (above) soon after he revealed his past life, a highly respected child psychiatrist who works with children who remember past lives, and does not think Ryan is lying . Ryan also recalls parting with Rita Hayworth (above) when he was Martin . Ryan's father (center) is a local police officer and neither her nor his wife knew anything about old Hollywood . Ryan was pointing to an extra in the film, a man with no lines that they later learned was bit-actor-turned-agent Marty Martin. That is when Cyndi decided Ryan should talk to someone, and the family found Dr. Jim Tucker, a highly respected child psychiatrist from the University of Virginia who has spent time talking with and studying children who claim to remember past lives. And even he noted there was something very special, and different, about Ryan. Most remarkable to Dr. Tucker, besides Ryan's incredible detail, was how accurate his claims matched up with the life of Martin, a virtual unknown who neither Ryan's family nor Dr. Tucker knew anything about, even his name, until they reached out to a film archivist. The film archivist gave them the name, and they then contacted one of Martin's daughters to ask about his life. That is when they discovered that 55 of Ryan's statements matched up perfectly with Martin's life - including the street he lived on, how many children he had, how many siblings he had and those aforementioned five marriages. The most shocking claim however came when Ryan told Dr. Tucker during a session one day that he wondered why God had him die at 61-years-old only to be reincarnated as a baby. This seemed to clash with Martin's death report, that stated he was 59 at the time he died. That is until Dr. Tucker looked through old census reports and discovered that the certificate, and not Ryan, was incorrect. The certificate claimed Martin was born in 1905 when in fact he had been born in 1903 according to the census. And so, Martin was likely 61 years old at the time of his death. Ryan now says his memories of Martin are starting to fade, and as for Dr. Tucker, he has compiled Ryan's story and other like it in his book Return To Life.",

'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Ron Hunter said after the game in a Vine video. The White House wouldn't apologize on Friday for Obama's incorrect assumption that the Baylor Bears, a 3-seed in the tournament, would prevail against the Georgia State Panthers. The president's spokesman did say, however that the young man who scored the winning basket 'certainly rose to the occasion.' Scroll down for video . RJ Hunter (left, with basketball) made a last-minute three-pointer to send his Georgia State Panthers to the next round of the NCAA Tournament . RJ's father Ron (center) , Georgia State's coach, fell off of his rolling chair, which he was forced to sit on after tearing his Achilles tendon on Sunday . The elder hunter was helped up from the floor by assistants after the stunning shot sank in, leading the 14-seed to upset 3-seed Baylor . Coach Hunter drew nationwide attention after he toppled off of the stool from which he had been cheering on his team after son RJ hit a deep three-pointer, putting the Panthers up 57-56 with 2.7 seconds remaining. Baylor had been favorited in the game by 9. With the younger Hunter on fire, scoring 16 points, Georgia State claimed victory in the final seconds of the game. The Panthers had been down by 12 with less than three minutes left before surging back for a stunning comeback and winning on the junior guard, according to ESPN. Remarking on the surprising come-from-behind win on Friday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, ''That was a great shot there at the end of the game.' 'I think there’s no question that...that kind of high- level performance when the chips are down is certainly the kind of...spirit that the president would hope to summon in the context of his job, too,' he added. Georgia State, in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2001, was picked by few to advance to the second round. President Barack Obama had Baylor winning the game in his bracket. 'I hope you make better decisions in your presidency than you did about Georgia State!' coach Hunter said after the game, teassing the president . Coach Hunter's assistants had to help him get back into his chair after he was literally floored by his son's last minute heroics. He had been perched on the rolling chair to reduce the strain of a Achilles tendon injury he incurred while celebrating the team's Sun Belt victory over Georgia Southern. The proud father, 50, was wearing a cast and often tried to stand up before being restrained by other coaches during the game. Georgia State will play No. 6 team Xavier in the next round of the NCAA tournament's West division of this year's bracket. Their victory was the second 3-seed upset of the day, coming after UAB's one-point win over Iowa State, favored by 14 points. The Georgia State squad is making its first appearance in the NCAA's big dance since 2001. Team members include former Louisville player Kevin Ware, who broke his leg at the tournament in 2013 in gruesome fashion.

Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona had two of the babies home with him on January 16, and the other two were cleared to leave the hospital on March 11. This after the babies were born premature and, in a tragic twist, his wife Erica, 36, passed away just one day after giving birth of hypovolemic shock which is caused by blood loss. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Recent widower and father of quadruplets, Carlos Morales, along with his late wife Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, say they are doing well thanks to help from generous supporters across the globe . Miracle: Even though Erica passed away, Carlos Morales considers the successful birth of his quadruplets a miracle and he is happy to have all four of them at his home . 'We’re just doing our best. I’m feeling really, really grateful for everybody that just came together and helped us,' Carlos told Today,referring to the nearly $350,000 raised on a  GoFundMe page set up for the family. Erica's mother, Sondra Bridges, now lives with Morales to help take care of the babies: Tracy, Paisley, Erica and Carlos, Jr. Bridges also gave thanks for the tremendous outpouring of support that the family received. 'It’s funny how things turn out. Bittersweet, but at the same time, thanks to God, and the outpouring support of the public, it’s been phenomenal,' she said. 'And I’d like to say thank you to each and every one of you. All the support we’ve gotten from you, we appreciate it.' Morales is sill mourning the  loss of Erica, however, with whom he dreamed of having a big family. The pair had gone through IVF fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family. But the last time Mr Morales saw his wife was when she kissed her on the head and said he loved her before going into labor at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital. Carlos Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, finally has his newborn quadruplets home with him . Tragic: Morales from Phoenix, Arizona, held the babies - three girls and one boy - after his wife Erica, 36, passed away on January 16. Their mother would never get to meet them . 'Look at these beautiful blessings,' Morales told People. 'Even when they scream their heads off I want to give them the biggest kiss.' He then added; 'I already know their quirky little habits or the next time they're going to cry. They're starting to form their own personalities.' And while he says dealing with four is a lot more difficult than dealing with two, he does have help thanks to his wife's mother-in-law, who moved down to help with the children. The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock, an emergency condition where one experiences a severe amount of blood loss. Just an hour later she died, and never got to hold them in her arms. Since then Mr Morales has been caring for the youngsters and has described the ordeal he has been through. 'We were so excited to start our family,' he told People magazine, 'And then it all came crashing down.' In the heartbreaking interview, he also described the moment the pair first met. 'I didn't speak any English and she didn't speak any Spanish,', laughing. 'But I asked her to dance and she said yes.' He then gave her his phone number, only to discover she had thrown the piece of paper out. Big dreams: Erica and Carlos dreamed of having a big family but sadly after giving birth to four children, Erica passed away at the hospital due to blood loss . Loving father: The children arrived one month before her due date. Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were delivered safely but the mother went into hypovolemic shock. She died an hour later . However they met each other through friends again and sparked a relationship. After marrying in Las Vegas in 2007, Mr Morales said they started trying for a baby right away. They went through a miscarriage, but were ecstatic when they found out the had a baby (before they realized it was mutiple) on the way. He told the magazine: 'Her doctor told her she had to just relax. So that's exactly what she did.' In a bid to prevent her from any undue stress, Mr Morales cooked, cleaned and made sure his wife stayed off her feet. She had been healthy throughout the pregnancy, but was admitted into hospital on January 12 because her blood pressure was high. Three days later, she texted her husband at his construction job and said doctors wanted to deliver right away. Bond: The pair got married in 2007 and tried for a baby straight away. After a miscarriage they opted for IVF. Mr Morales said 'We were so excited to start our family. And then it all came crashing down.' 'The doctor said she was having too many contractions so it was time to deliver the babies,' he said: 'We took pictures before she went into the delivery room, made some videos, and she was surrounded by family and friends. I said to her, 'Let's get these babies out'.' They began discussing names, but Mrs Morales said the pair could decide after they were born. After the birth the babies were laid down in a nursery, Mr Morales went in and squeezed his wife hand as she woke up. A short time later alarms from the equipment surrounding her bed started going off. The next thing Mr Morales was told is that his wife was dead. Describing what happened to People, he said: 'How could this have happened? She was fine, and then she wasn't. She was alive and then she was just gone. 'I went from having the best day of my life to the next morning experiencing the worst day of my life.' The nurse then brought the babies into the room and he held them on his lap. The nurse asked for their names and he gave her three they had agreed on and one he decided himself - Erica. Heartbreaking: Mr Morales and his wife (pictured during pregnancy) started discussing names before she went into labor. She then told they would decide after they were born . During his visits he is taking classes to make sure he gives his children the best care possible. He told the magazine 'I'm learning everything from how to give them a bath, CPR, feeding, and how to manage their sleep schedule. I need to be prepared.' When he was looking on his wife's iPad, Mr Morales found a note she had written. It described how she wanted her children to go to college, speak both Spanish and English, and get good jobs. Mrs Morales went into hospital with a swollen foot and tests showed her blood pressure to be 190/90. On that day she wrote on Facebook: 'He said I have to get admitted until delivery. It's been down lower today but it's too late. 'He will keep me and he ordered some labs. 'He will push deliver up or stall it to to 34 weeks. I'm 31 tomorrow. He said I did phenomenal. A poster child for quads. 'He wish they could all go this way but this last part we have to do it carefully because u can stroke out with bad blood pressure.

The revelations came just weeks after publisher Pan MacMillan dumped her controversial cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way for New Mums, Babies and Toddlers, after public health experts expressed alarm over a DIY baby formula recipe in the book. 'I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured,' Ms Carr said today about her decision to do voice-overs for the junk food brands.

Ms Carr said it was difficult to select individual voice-over roles because she worked as a freelancer and often received offers as a package deal. She said she was talking to her agent about choosing 'roles that align more closely to my values'. Ms Carr, Mr Evans and nutritionist Helen Padarin are forging ahead with plans to independently publish their controversial cookbook in a digital format next month. The book has copped heavy criticism from dietitians and health authorities, with the president of the Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA), Heather Yeatman, quoted saying 'a baby may die if this book goes ahead'. The PHAA said its DIY baby milk formula, which is based on liver and bone broth formula, contained excessive amounts of Vitamin A. In an interview about the book with the That Paleo Show podcast, Ms Carr said there had been a 'censorship issue' with the recipe. 'I think we need to look at possibly where the comments have come from and who sponsors those organisations,' she said. 'It's a very, very big issue here. 'It's also a censorship issue, you know? This has been promoted and printed I know it's well over 500,000 times because the (inaudible) manual has been printed that many times already. 'And it's in many, many other books across the world.' 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers' will be published independently online. Pan MacMillan Australia will not publish the book after concerns were raised by health experts . 'As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be', Ms Carr said in a statement . 'Paleo Pete' Evans has become one of Australia's leading spruikers of the paleo diet . A spokesman for Pan Macmillan Australia would not comment on censorship claims. 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum – The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' he said in a statement. Public Health Association CEO Michael Moore told Daily Mail Australia the real issue was that specific diets discourage parents from breastfeeding. 'If adults want to use a paleo diet, even though it's rated amongst the worst diets of the world, then so be it,' he said. 'When you start talking about specific diets for infants... It discourages from breastfeeding and there's huge amounts of research around the world that breastfeeding's best.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said authorities recommend that parents use commercial infant formulas if an infant is not breastfed. She said the paleo formula is also concerning because it contains one-tenth of the calcium of breast milk, 879 per cent the sodium of breast milk, and 168 per cent the selenium of breast milk. 'These are important nutrients to get right in the diets of babies,' the spokeswoman said. As a hard working mum to my beautiful baby boy Willow, and like most Australians, my family are my highest priority and will always be. I often have little control over the jobs that are contracted to me as a voice over artist, like so many freelancers in my field. I am frequently presented with a package rather than specific clients that I can pick and choose from. Over the years as I have become devoted to eating and living a specific way, due to the health concerns of my family, I have been working with my agent to choose roles that align more closely to my values. I have never \"personally \"endorsed any of these products since becoming a holistic health coach and baby food blogger. I am a working mother and like everyone else, will do everything I can to keep my family safe and nurtured. If Im telling you through advertising on television or radio to buy a certain car, or catch a certain airline, or use a certain toothbrush, I may not drive that certain car, or use that airline or use that toothbrush. I originally created this page out of love and kindness and to share my story so that any Mum in a similar position who has been told to put their child on a gluten free and dairy free diet would have a place to come to for inspiration and ideas. When you are told your child can not have these foods, sometimes its overwhelming and scary and you are unsure where to start. Its a lonely place. This is why I created Bubba Yum Yum.

Just days after designers Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce called children born through IVF 'synthetic,' critics of the brand have publicized the brand's highly controversial Spring/Summer 2007 campaign ad that showed a woman being restrained by a bare-chested man as a group of men in various states of undress look on. The advertisement was banned from being used in Italian publications after it ran several times when it was determined that it 'offended the dignity of the woman,' and pulled in the United States after running just once in an issue of Esquire. When the ad was first pulled in Spain, the design duo referred to the people of that country as 'a bit backward.' Scroll down for video . Dolce & Gabbana have come under fire again, this time for a 2007 ad that depicts the gang rape of a woman who is being restrained as a group of men look on (above) The duo also depicted a group sex scene featuring all men in another ad that was slightly more graphic, though the man was not being restrained (above) An ad from the same campaign shot that featured the men dressed and in which the woman was not restrained did run in magazines (above) Publicist Kelly Cutrone posted the ad to her Twitter account on Sunday, writing; 'I GUESS SIMULATING GANG BANGS ARE FINE - BUT IVF AND SAME SEX MARRIAGE ARE NOT - LIFE ACCORDING TO @dolcegabbana.' The ad actually features one of Cutrone's former costars on the MTV reality series The City, model Adam Senn. The duo also depicted a group sex scene featuring all men in another ad that was slightly more graphic, though the man, unlike the woman, was not being restrained. Dolce said in the most recent issue of Panoroma magazine; 'You are born and you have a father and a mother. At least it should be like that. 'That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies. 'They are wombs for hire, semen chosen from a catalogue. And then you have to explain to these children who their mother is.' This after the men chose motherhood as the theme of their Fall/Winter 2015 fashion show held earlier this month in Milan. Parents of IVF babies, among them Elton John, Al Roker, and Ricky Martin, came out against the two following these statements, as did celebrities including Victoria Beckham and Courtney Love. Kelly Cutrone (left) posted the old ad on her Twitter, attacking Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce (right) John wrote on Instagram following then incident; 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as \"synthetic\". And shame on you for wagging your judgemental little fingers at IVF - a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children. 'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again.' Now many have publicly declared they will boycott the duo's designs. Dolce and Gabbana meanwhile have said their statements were taken out of context, with Dolce saying; 'I am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families and they are as legitimate as the one I've known.'",

        "input_text": "Three women tortured a man by pressing burning hair tongs and a cigarette lighter on to his genitals when they found he had dated three people at once, a court has heard. The trio also taunted the victim with a pizza cutter in what was described as like a scene from Reservoir Dogs. Lorraine Earles, 47, Natalie Lilley, 19, Leah White, 22, along with male defendant Brendan Teale, 27, had plotted revenge on the victim for allegedly seeing several women at a time and lured him to a flat in Scarborough before strapping him to a chair. Natalie Lilley, who appeared at York Crown Court after admitting torturing a man in a scene like the film Reservoir Dogs . The three women and one man then carried out a prolonged attack on the victim, who was also forced to drink liquid wash before having the hot curling tongs pressed to his genitals. York Crown Court heard one of his tormentors also burnt him with a cigarette lighter as the others laughed and giggled. During the torture he also had a pizza cutter pressed to his cheek and was punched, kicked and slapped repeatedly. The court heard Earles bit the man's ear, pushed his head down to his knees and used a cigarette lighter to burn the back of his neck, before threatening to suffocate him as she put a scarf around his mouth. She then ordered White to burn his genitals with hair curling tongs before pulling the chair back, causing him to fall backwards onto the floor. Leah White, who also took part in the attack, which saw the man have burning hot hair tongs pressed on his genitals . The frightening escalation of the assault prompted White and Lilley to alert Teale, who was reputedly the ringleader of the assault and took part in the beating, but had retired to a bedroom before Earles upped the ante in a scene reminiscent of the bloody Quentin Tarantino film. Teale untied the victim and picked him up off the floor, then went back to the bedroom and fell asleep, while Earles nodded off on a sofa. White then took the flat door keys out of his pocket and released the victim, whose Blackberry phone had been stolen and later pawned by Teale. The four torture suspects were later arrested after the victim's step-mother called police. York Crown Court heard each blamed one another for the sickening attack but Teale and Earles were found to be the main protagonists. The four suspects were originally charged with falsely imprisoning the man on November 10, 2013, but this was eventually dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service and they each pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. They appeared for sentence on Friday, when the court heard that Teale - who has previous convictions for assault and battery - had been smoking cannabis on the day in question. After being bailed by police, he went on to commit a burglary and was also charged with handling stolen goods taken in a separate raid. White, who had once been in a relationship with the victim, and Lilley, a mother-of-one on benefits, both had clean records up until the attack. Barrister Andrew Temple, for Teale, said the defendants had lured the man to the flat to teach him a lesson for allegedly seeing several women at the same time, but he claimed that Earles had been the 'main player' in the torture scene. Laura Addy, for Earles, said her client had severe mental health issues and was under Teale's spell. York Crown Court, pictured, heard how as the victim's burnt him with a cigarette lighter the others laughed and giggled. White's defence barrister Glen Parsons said she had acted 'wholly out of character' under orders from others.' 'Her role was to use the (curling) tongs but she insisted they weren't on full heat,' he added. Recorder Bernard Gateshill told the defendants: 'You all participated in an attack upon (the victim) which was designed to embarrass and humiliate him.' Earles, of Scarborough, was spared a jail sentence because she had spent five months on remand and was 'clearly a troubled woman with a history of psychological difficulties'. She was given a two-year community order with supervision, ordered to attend the Women's Community Project in Scarborough for a 20-day course, and made to pay a £60 victim surcharge. Teale, of Malton, was jailed for 12 months for actual bodily harm, burglary and the handling offence. Lilley, of Scarborough, was given a two-year community order with supervision and 100 hours' unpaid work. White was also given a two-year community punishment and ordered to take part in a 16-day course at the Women's Community Project.",

        "input_text": "A 15-year-old north Florida girl who authorities say fatally shot her 16-year-old brother after years of abuse at home pleaded no contest on Thursday to felony burglary and will receive probation and counseling. The girl's probation will last until her 19th birthday, and is contingent upon her participation in counseling, and testifying truthfully in the case of her parents, who face felony child abuse charges, Third Circuit State Attorney Jeff Siegmeister said. 'This child has the best chance at a normal adult life by receiving the therapy and education she needs and residing in the setting of her current foster home,' he said. A 15-year-old girl (left) and her 11-year-old sister (right) have not been charged with murder after the eldest girl fatally shot her 16-year-old brother at their Florida home in January. The eldest will receive probation and counseling . The girl and her 11-year-old sister were initially arrested on suspicion of murder after the January 5 shooting in Lake City. No charges were filed against the younger sister. The names of the members of the family are not being released because of the girls' ages and because of abuse allegations. On January 5, the girls and their three-year-old sister were left by their parents in the care of their brother. The parents were away on a work-related truck drive. Police say the brother locked the elder sister in her room, but when he fell asleep, she persuaded the 11-year-old to let her out so she could shower. The boy, 16, was killed by his sister, 15, on January 5 after she escaped the room her brother had locked her in and shot him in the neck . The older sister asked her younger sister to keep watch as she went outside and cut out the air conditioner of her parents' locked bedroom window to retrieve a pistol. The girl asked her younger sister to take their three-year-old sister and hide in a closet before she shot her brother in the neck as he slept, police said. The two older girls fled the house, leaving the toddler behind. They were later found by police outside a Dollar General store after the younger girl called a friend saying she needed a ride. Documents show that the elder girl suffered years of abuse, including being locked in her bedroom for days regularly with only a blanket and a bucket to use the bathroom. The longest they kept the girl locked in her room was 20 consecutive days, the father told police. In the room, police found only a blanket and a bucket filled with urine in the closet, allegedly a punishment because the teenage girl was stealing and talking back. Letters from the parents asking her why she should be let out of that room were also found in the police investigation. 'It was learned that (the 15-year-old girl) has made past attempts at ending her life but neither law enforcement nor (emergency management services) was notified,' police wrote in their January report. In addition, documents showed that she had been sexually abused by her uncle, who was convicted in 2010. The uncle was arrested in December 2010 on sex charges after his wife found a USB with movie clips of him and the 15-year-old engaged in sexual acts. It had been going on for some time. According to police documents, his wife reported seeing a video clip of the girl sitting down and a man with his penis out, standing behind her. He then had oral sex with the underage girl, while she made noises, the wife told police. The victim later told investigators that she did not want it to happen. The uncle had told her to 'suck on his thingy' and that 'they were to be private and not to tell anyone no matter what'. The abuse had been going on 'for a long time', according to the police report, and the videotaping for about a year. The parents have been charged with child neglect and failing to supervise. The girls' mother told police that they often locked the 15-year-old girl up when she misbehaved . The uncle was convicted and is on the registered sex offender's list. Authorities also said the children's mother had discovered the siblings having sex in 2011. The mother reported to police that she heard noises coming from the bedroom and found the teenage boy having sex with his sister, who is a year younger. The mother told police that she separated the siblings and asked them what happened. The girl told her mother that she did not want to 'do it' with her brother but he put pressure on her. She also referenced the earlier abuse by her uncle. After an investigation by child welfare officials, no one was charged. Her parents had also removed her from school, documents show. Siegmeister said all of the family's history and circumstances were taken into consideration in the decision not to pursue more serious criminal charges. 'This case is a tragedy to all those involved: the deceased, the two arrested children, as well as their 3-year-old sister who has been separated from them both. Further incarceration... serves no deterrent, rehabilitative nor other societal interest,' he said.",

        "input_text": "Kathleen Wyatt has won the right to fight for a  payout from her ex-husband  energy businessman Dale Vince, 20 years after they divorced . She has taken jobs picking fruit, and since the mid-1990s has lived largely on benefits. Her current home is a former council house in Monmouth, south Wales, bought on a mortgage for £60,000 under right-to-buy laws. It was described in court as being damp and badly heated. By contrast, her former husband has founded Ecotricity, now one of the UK's biggest green energy companies, worth at least £57million. The strict vegan lives in a £3million 18th century castle near Stroud, Gloucestershire, with his second wife and their five-year-old son. Mr Vince also owns Forest Green Rovers football club where he has banned red meat for players and supporters. Mr Vince's son Dane moved in with his father in 2001 after the business began to take off. In December 2012 a judge ordered the ex-husband to pay Ms Wyatt £125,000. But he challenged the ruling and Appeal Court judges struck it out. Yesterday, Supreme Court justices ruled in favour of Ms Wyatt and said her claim should be heard by a judge in the Family Division of the High Court. She is demanding almost £2million. Lord Wilson, speaking for all five justices, said that under 1973 divorce legislation the courts should have taken into account the years Ms Wyatt looked after the couple's son. 'He was brought up by Ms Wyatt,' the judge said. 'She struggled to do so. They were 16 years of real hardship for her and her family. At times they lived in caravans. They moved home frequently. They lived from hand to mouth.' Lord Wilson said the burden had fallen on Ms Wyatt and her contribution had been unmatched by Mr Vince. Mr Vince turned from New Age traveller to the founder of a multi-million green energy firm, Ecotricity . Kathleen Wyatt (left) pictured with lawyer Barbara Reeves (right) after justices said the case could be heard . Ms Wyatt is pictured leaving the Supreme Court today (left) after judges ruled her application can be heard by the High Court and in  2003 (right) after the two New Age travellers had divorced . As a result, the case should now be reconsidered by a family court, he said. Lord Wilson added: 'Unwisely, Miss Wyatt has pitched her claim at £1.9million and it is obvious … that an award approaching that size is out of the question. Her claim may even be dismissed. Kathleen Wyatt's legal victory opens the way for divorcees to claim a pay-off from their ex-spouse decades later. Supreme Court judges – Lady Hale, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson, Lord Hughes and Lord Hodge – said Appeal judges had been wrong to throw Ms Wyatt's original case out on the basis she had no reasonable grounds, in 2013. The justices said under the 1973 Matrimonial Causes Act, a family judge in a divorce case must consider who has cared for the home and any children. Lawyers said the case would encourage copycat claims. James Brown, of firm JMW, said: 'It amounts to nothing short of a call to action … [It] underlines how there is no limit on when someone can make a claim. It doesn't matter whether you divorce in your 20s and return with a claim when you're 80.' There was no recorded financial settlement from Ms Wyatt's divorce. 'But there is … a real prospect that she will secure a comparatively modest award, perhaps of a size which would enable her to purchase a somewhat more comfortable mortgage-free home.' Ms Wyatt's solicitor, Barbara Reeves of law firm Mishcon de Reya, said: 'She looks forward to concluding the litigation as quickly as possible.' Ms Reeves added that Mishcon would try to win a costs order against Mr Vince to cover its fees, which have so far swallowed up all but £2,539 of the £125,000 awarded to Ms Wyatt in the earlier court hearing. After the ruling, Mr Vince said: 'I am disappointed that the Supreme Court has decided not to bring this case to an end now, over 30 years since the relationship ended. 'We both moved on and started families of our own. 'For my part the passing of time is extremely prejudicial, it's been so long that there are no records … it's hard to defend yourself in such circumstances. Indeed, the delay itself has enabled the claim, because there is no paperwork in existence.' He added: 'I feel that we all have a right to move on and not be looking over our shoulders. This could signal open season for people who had brief relationships a quarter of a century ago. It's mad in my opinion.' Ecotricity has earned Mr Vince considerable wealth and he spent almost £1million building his electric supercar, Nemesis, from a second hand second-hand Lotus Exige. It can reach speeds of up to 170mph . Vince lives in an 18th century fort in Stroud in Gloucestershire, which he bought for around £3million . Millionaire is the chairman of Forest Green FC and was pictured watching a match against Stockport in 201 . Mr Vince received an OBE at Buckingham Palace in 2004 for services to the environment.

The UH-60 Black Hawk crashed in the Gulf of Mexico close to Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday night. Search teams have been combing the water for clues and said they are clinging to hope despite human remains being discovered. Debris from the crash has also washed up on shore, including the landing gear and the side of the helicopter with the glass from the windows missing. Scroll down for video . Missing: Seven Marines and four soldiers are presumed dead after a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed in the Gulf of Mexico during a night training mission. Above, some of the debris that washed ashore on Wednesday morning . Survivors? Pentagon officials say the 11 on board are presumed dead but local authorities stress that it is still a search and rescue mission - not search and recover. Above, a door or window from the helicopter . Other parts thought to be from the helicopter have continued to wash up on the beach, including this wheel . Washing up: A glove washed up on a stretch of military-owned beach on Wednesday morning following a Black Hawk helicopter crash around 12 hours earlier . Foggy conditions remained on Wednesday morning which forced the rescue teams to take an 'operational pause', an Eglin Air Force Base spokesman said. The spokesman told NBC News: 'There is always room for optimism. The fog has been hampering our search efforts, and more fog is continuing to roll in.' The comments came as hundreds of people attended a vigil and lit candles for the missing servicemen. Dolly Edwards, 35, said she attended the vigil, held on the end of a nearby pier, to pay her respects as the soldiers were only in the area for training. 'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training — knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' she told UTSanDiego.com. Norman Caron, a retired airman, added: 'We just need to be here to pay respects.' While a Pentagon official said the men were presumed dead, the hunt for the crashed helicopter remains a search and rescue mission and not search and recovery. Thick fog: The are was under fog advisory when the crash took place. Military officials who spoke with Daily Mail Online says local pilots are used to the conditions but the pilot who was flying at the time was from Louisiana or North Carolina. Above, a file photo of a UH-60 Black Hawk - not the one that crashed . Hard to see: Military personnel wade in the water and search on the beach under heavy fog at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida on Wednesday . A serviceman collects debris along the beach of what might be the wreckage of the military helicopter . Evidence: A man walks the beach near where debris washed up Wednesday morning following the helicopter crash, and appears to be picking up remnants of the crash . Base officials said the Marines were part of a Camp Lejeune-based, 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Jacksonville, North Carolina. The soldiers were from a National Guard unit based in Hammond, Louisiana. The massive Black Hawk has been the workhorse of the U.S. Army since 1979. They are primarily used to ferry troops to and from the battlefields, and support aircraft, but adapted models carry out medical evacuations with state-of-the-art equipment, search-and-rescue, armed escort and warfare missions. Black Hawks were a central part of the U.S. military attack on Somalia capital, Mogadishu in 1993. They were also used in military operations in the Balkan region and Haiti in the 1990s; and supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The aircraft has also been used prominently by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft based in Stratford, Connecticut. It flies low to the ground to avoid detection and its twin-turbine engine can deliver a maximum speed of roughly 180mph. During an afternoon press conference, Major General Glenn Curtis of the Louisiana National Guard confirmed that all of his soldiers were male and that three had aided in the Hurricane Katrina response. He described his men as 'tremendous pilots' and 'tremendous soldiers' Two Black Hawks took off together from the base ahead of the crash on Tuesday night. It is unclear how many soldiers were on board the other aircraft. A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that training missions usually took off from Eglin on a daily basis and said that it was up to individual units whether to fly in adverse weather conditions such as heavy fog. Fog was common in the region, the spokesperson said, and local pilots were used to the conditions.  The pilot on the Black Hawk which crashed on Tuesday night was from either Louisiana or North Carolina. The helicopter was reported missing around 8.30pm on Tuesday and search and rescue crews found debris from the crash around 2am on Wednesday. Kim Urr, 62, who works at the nearby Navarre Beach campground, said she heard a strange sound, followed by two explosions around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. 'It sounded like something metal either being hit or falling over, that's what it sounded like. And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,' Urr said. The tail rotor of the helicopter with its ID number was found during the rescue mission, according to military officials. Names of those involved were not immediately released, pending notification of next-of-kin. But Mike Spinks from Eglin Environmental Public Affairs told WKRG: 'There is always hope.' The Army helicopter took off from a nearby airport in Destin and joined other aircraft in the training exercise. The UH-60 helicopter went down during a routine training mission off a remote stretch of beach between Pensacola and Destin. Two helicopters were flying a night training mission, but only one of the helicopters returned. Above patrol boats search the waters near the crash site on Wednesday .

Seven Marines and four soldiers aboard an Army helicopter that crashed over waters off Florida during a routine night training mission were presumed dead on Wednesday . The search for the missing Black Hawk helicopter was being hampered by heavy fog in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday morning . The beach is owned by the military and is used for test missions. The training area includes 20 miles of pristine beachfront that has been under the control of the military since before World War II. Military police keep a close watch on the area and have been known to run off private vendors who rent jet skis or paddle boards without permission. Test range manager Glenn Barndollar said in August that the beach provides an ideal training area for special operations units from all branches of the military to practice over the water, on the beach and in the bay. The military sometimes drops trainees over the water using boats or helicopters and the trainees must make their way onshore. The black helicopter that crashed was a newer model that had a black box, which could shed light on what caused the crash if located. Military officials said on Tuesday night that the names of those involved were not immediately released following the crash off Eglin Air Force Base pending notification of next-of-kin .

        "input_text": "U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was brutally beaten, kept chained inside a cage, blindfolded and threatened with execution during his five years in captivity, he has claimed while speaking out for the first time. The former prisoner of war, who was captured by the Taliban in 2009 and released as part of a controversial prisoner swap last year, detailed his imprisonment for the first time in a statement released by his lawyer on Wednesday. It came after the Army charged the 28-year-old with desertion and misbehavior in the face of the enemy. He could get life in prison if convicted of the latter, more serious charge. Bergdahl vanished from Combat Outpost Mest-Lalak in Paktika Province in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009 while on morning guard duty. He left behind his weapon, ammunition and body armor. Scroll down for videos . Imprisoned: Bowe Bergdahl, pictured two weeks after he was captured in Afghanistan in 2009, has described his brutal living conditions while held captive - including beatings, little light and shackles . Captivity: Bergdahl, pictured in December 2010, said he tried to escape on multiple occasions and once managed to hide for nine days - but he was always caught and beaten by his captors . He was later captured by the Taliban and within hours, he quickly learned the nature of the people he had met. His minders briefly left him alone in a village where he was being interrogated and beaten . for evading questions. 'After a while they put the blindfold back on and threw the . blanket over my head. Some moments after that I believed I had a . chance to run for it and did,' Bergdahl wrote in his statement. He was tackled near the outskirts of the village by a large . group of men who pummeled him with their fists and clubbed him . with the butt of an AK-47 rifle, snapping off the stock. He tried to escape again near the end of his first week as a . prisoner, eluding his captors for about 15 minutes, his statement said, but he was found and beaten . with a thick rubber hose. Swap: Footage shows a Blackhawk helicopter waiting as Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl (in white) is led from his Taliban captors to American military during his release at the Afghan border on June 4, 2014 . Heading home: Bergdahl is pictured inside a vehicle guarded by the Taliban in Afghanistan before the swap . 'After my first two escape attempts, for about three months I was chained to a bed spread-eagle and blindfolded,' he said. 'The blindfold was only taken off a few times a day to allow me to eat and use the latrine.' Bergdahl said it was not until his muscles began to atrophy . and he began to have trouble walking that his captors unchained . one of his hands from above his head and tied it to his side, . allowing him to sit up in bed. He developed sores from the chafing of the chains and they . became infected, with the infection spreading to his face and . other parts of his body, he said. After the first three months or so he was . never fully chained to a bed again, but he was forced to remain . in chains attached to unmovable objects. After a year of captivity, he was placed in a cage, where his hands were kept in chains. His feet were also chained to the cage every night for a year, he said. Charges: On Wednesday, U.S. Army Col. Daniel King spoke from Fort Bragg (pictured) about the charges against Bergdahl, who has been charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy . Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl deserted his platoon in June 2009 during morning guard duty, his comrades have said . Eventually his captors stopped chaining his feet because of 'acute pain' which developed into a 'freezing numbness that continues to the present, as both feet have neuropathy'. Bergdahl faces charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice: . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service'. It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . Maximum sentence: Five years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': Article 99 charges a service member with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy' Maximum sentence: Life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . The cage was over plumbing where he could relieve himself. He said he was fed elbow noodles or rice and very little . else. He received two bottles of water a day. The bottoms of his . feet and other parts of his body were regularly beaten with a . copper cable. 'I was kept in constant isolation during the entire five years, with little to no understanding of time, through periods of constant darkness, periods of constant light, and periods of completely random flickering of light, and absolutely no understanding of anything that was happening behind the door I was held behind,' Bergdahl said in the statement. His captors would also often play mind games with him, he said. They would tell him he was about to be executed or that he was going to be released - or that he was going to be there for 30 years. Toward the end of his first year in captivity, Bergdahl said . he managed to escape again. He got away from the building where . he was being held and remained at large for about nine days in . increasingly desperate circumstances. 'Without food and only putrid water to drink, my body failed . on top of a short mountain close to evening,' he wrote. He was eventually found by a Taliban search group that brutally beat him, he said. 'One tried to rip my beard and hair out, but from what I could sense they where [sic] more worried about getting me out of that area as quickly as possible,' he said. The Taliban Five: The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . 'This is the time that my body reached the worst point of . condition and for approximately the next year and a half I would . not recover from it.' The statement was released via his attorney, Eugene Fidell, after the charges were announced. Last year, the Obama administration released five Taliban leaders in exchange for Bergdahl's return - but the celebration of his release was shortlived after his former comrades came forward and said he had deserted his post and forced them to carry out dangerous mission to try to find him. Bergdahl faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if . convicted of the misbehavior charge. He could also be reduced in rank to private, forfeit all salary . and be given a dishonorable discharge.",

Families are better off than when the Coalition came to power, the economy is growing faster than expected and consumers are more confident than they have been for more than 12 years, official figures revealed yesterday. On day two of the election campaign, the Conservatives were boosted by a string of economic indicators – crowned by Office for National Statistics figures showing Britain is enjoying its strongest growth since 2006. The UK is out-performing all other leading economies, including the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany and France. In seven signs that the economy is on the up following the worst slump since the 1930s: . Labour has repeatedly claimed that families are £1,600 a year worse off than they were when the Coalition came to power, but shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie last night conceded that living standards appeared to be ‘crawling back to the levels that we were at five years ago’. As David Cameron claimed the Tories would help business to create two million more jobs over the next five years if they remained in power, on top of 1.9 million since 2010, independent economists said the Government could boast a ‘remarkable’ record on employment. Car giant Honda announced a £200million investment in its Wiltshire plant - one of the many signs the economy is on the up . Chancellor George Osborne hailed ‘a hat-trick of good news about the British economy’, insisting: ‘With 37 days to go until the election, it’s another sign that changing course would put recovery at risk. Voters now face a stark choice: do we stick with a plan which is working, delivering growth and jobs, or do we put all that at risk with Ed Miliband whose policies of more spending, more borrowing and higher taxes will lead to economic chaos?’ Labour had planned to use Ronald Reagan’s famous question – ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago’ – as a central plank of its election campaign, but the pressure on family finances has eased in recent months as the cost of food and fuel tumbles and wages rise. Inflation has fallen to zero – its lowest level for more than half a century – and Britain looks set for a period of deflation or falling prices. Overall, it means the average British voter now has more cash to spend than they did at the 2010 election. Household spending per head also rose by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of last year. Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie  conceded that living standards appeared to be ‘crawling back to the levels of five years ago’ Yesterday’s ONS figures showed the economy has grown by more than 8 per cent since the last election, having crashed by 6 per cent in the so-called ‘Great Recession’ under Labour. The UK economy is now 3.7 per cent bigger than at any time in history. Business investment rose by 7.5 per cent last year to a record £179.7billion in an indication that companies are confident enough to spend for the future. And exports rose by 4.6 per cent in the final three months of 2014 despite the ongoing crisis in the Eurozone. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ‘Rescuing our economy was the main reason that the Liberal Democrats formed the Coalition. This upward revision in GDP is further evidence that our recovery plan is working.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said the recovery had been the slowest in 100 years. ‘A small upward revision today in the GDP figures doesn’t change that overall record. This has been a disappointing recovery and it didn’t have to be this way,’ he said. Experts said Britain was on course for another strong year in 2015. Andrew Sentance, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said: ‘We should expect GDP forecasts for this year to be revised upwards on the back of this data. It is still entirely possible that the UK will head the G7 growth league in 2015, as we did last year.’ However, in a setback for the Government, the services sector, which powers much of the economy, has slipped back. Output from services firms – which make up about 78 per cent of GDP and range from hotels to hairdressers – fell 0.2 per cent in January. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said the services figures were ‘disappointing’ but described them as a ‘blip’. Labour claims... versus the reality: James Slack's analysis . Yesterday, on Day Two of the campaign, myths peddled by Ed Miliband and his shadow ministers over the past five years were exploded. Here, we examine the key facts to emerge on what could be a pivotal day in the battle for No 10... Ed Miliband and his shadow ministers have peddled myths over the past five years and on Day Two of the election campaign they exploded . LABOUR CLAIM: ‘This has been a disappointing recovery and it didn’t have to be this way.’ REALITY: In 2014, GDP grew by 2.8 per cent – revised up from 2.6 per cent yesterday and the fastest annual rate of growth since 2006. Britain had the strongest annual growth rate in the G7 in 2014. Canada, the next highest, grew at a rate of 2.5 per cent. CLAIM: ‘Living standards have fallen. Families are £1,600 worse off.’ REALITY: Real Household Disposable Income per head was up by 1.9 per cent in the final three months of 2014 compared to 12 months earlier. Living standards are now officially higher than when the Coalition took office. Disposable income – a calculation of incomings versus outgoings – now stands at £4,187 compared to £4,178 in the second quarter of 2010. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicts families will be £900 better off by the end of 2015. Labour’s £1,600 figure excludes tax changes and dates from April 2014: since then inflation has fallen sharply while pay rises have improved. CLAIM: ‘It is a complete fantasy the private sector could mop up the jobs lost during cuts to the private sector.’ REALITY: The Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday said ‘the economy has done incredibly well in terms of job creation’. Employment is up by 1.9million since the election with an average of 1,000 jobs being created every day. For every one job lost in the public sector, four have been created in the private sector. Unemployment is down 654,000 since 2010 to 1.86million. CLAIM: ‘Consumers lack confidence. They are not feeling the recovery in a tangible way.’ The number of people working full-time has risen by 1.42million - 75% of the rise in employment since the election has been in full-time jobs . REALITY: The internationally-respected GfK Consumer Confidence measure – a large-scale survey of the public’s personal finances, savings and optimism about the future – rose to +4 in March, its highest level since June 2002. Over the past year it has risen by nine points. This compares to a record low of -39 during the Labour years, recorded at the height of the financial crisis in July 2008. Real household spending after inflation rose by 0.3 per cent in the year to December 2014. It has risen by 3 per cent since the Coalition came to power. CLAIM: ‘Investment in business is woefully weak.’ REALITY: ONS figures show business investment is the fastest growing part of GDP – up by 7.8 per cent in 2014. CLAIM: ‘Hard-working people are being held back by the scourge of zero hours contracts.’ REALITY: The number of people working full-time has risen by 1.42million. Three-quarters of the rise in employment since the election has been in full-time jobs. Three-fifths of the growth in employment since 2010 has been in higher skilled occupations. ‘No matter where you may be, you are sure to get everyone and neighbouring surroundings in the picture’. VERDICT: Yesterday was a big moment for the Tories, providing them with a chance to deliver a positive message after days of negative campaigning over Labour’s tax and spending plans. It also dealt a significant blow to Ed Miliband’s ‘cost of living crisis’ line of attack. The challenge for the Tories is to find a way of hammering home their economic successes – something they have failed to consistently do so far – without sounding triumphalist. Not every family feels better-off yet. While it is of huge political significance that living standards are now higher than in May 2010, the average household has only a tenner more to spend.",

        "input_text": "David Cameron was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell-by date on his premiership yesterday as senior Tories accused him of trying to anoint George Osborne as his successor. Downing Street was struggling to contain the fallout from the Prime Minister’s extraordinary announcement that May’s general election will be his last. Friends dismissed rumours that Mr Cameron’s wife, Samantha, had asked him to make clear he would not seek a third term if re-elected, while Mr Cameron insisted he had simply given a ‘straight answer to a straight question’ and that most people would think that was a ‘sensible’ thing to do. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) was forced to defend his decision to announce a sell-by date on his premiership yesterday as senior Tories accused him of trying to anoint George Osborne as his successor . As Labour accused him of ‘arrogance’ for discussing a third election before he wins a second, he insisted he was ‘taking absolutely nothing for granted’. ‘My entire focus is on the next 44 days and the general election that will decide which team runs the country for the next five years,’ Mr Cameron said. But senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. It came as Mr Cameron was reminded of his comments to Tony Blair when the former premier announced he was handing over the reins to then-Chancellor Gordon Brown mid-term. ‘Your authority is draining away,’ he told Mr Blair in the Commons in January 2007. ‘The Government can’t plan. Ministers are treading water. They are all waiting for the Chancellor and not listening to you.’ One former shadow minister said that by indicating he will depart in the next Parliament, Mr Cameron appeared to be seeking to head off moves to oust him on May 8 if he falls short of a Commons majority and tries to lead another coalition or a minority government. David Cameron has revealed he will stand down as Prime Minister before 2020 if he wins the next election . Senior MPs warned that pre-announcing a departure before the 2020 election would inevitably undermine his authority if he remained in No 10. Pictured: David Cameron visits a butchers in his Oxfordshire constituency . ‘He may think it will be harder for the men in the grey suits to come knocking when he has said he won’t be going on and on,’ the MP said. ‘The truth is he won’t last five minutes, let alone five years, if he loses again.’ There was particular consternation that Mr Cameron effectively fired the starting gun on a leadership contest by naming three potential successors: Home Secretary Theresa May, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Mr Osborne, the Chancellor. Mrs May and Mr Johnson have long been seen the leading rivals to be the next Tory leader, but Mr Cameron sparked frenzied speculation at Westminster by including his name of Mr Osborne, his closest ally. Since his unpopular Budget of 2012, Mr Osborne’s leadership prospects have been discounted by many. Boris Johnson . Boris Johnson is the favourite among voters to succeed David Cameron, a poll reveals today. But the London Mayor repeatedly refused to say whether he would join a leadership contest. Chancellor George Osborne is thought to be the Prime Minister’s preference to be his successor. But in a ComRes survey for the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson was backed by 31 per cent of voters, ahead of Theresa May on 17 per cent and Mr Osborne on 12 per cent. Support for the Mayor among Tory voters was particularly strong – 36 per cent said he would make the best prime minister, Mr Osborne was on 25 per cent and Mrs May on 18 per cent. Mr Johnson’s strongest backing was among Ukip supporters, at 44 per cent – suggesting he would do the best job of regaining support from the Eurosceptic party. He was also backed by 32 per cent of Labour voters, ahead of Mrs May on 19 per cent, and the Chancellor on 7 per cent. But in an LBC Radio interview yesterday, Mr Johnson dodged questions about his ambitions more than a dozen times. He is bidding to return as an MP in May in the safe seat of Uxbridge, but claimed Mr Cameron’s intervention was ‘no big deal’. ‘All he’s saying is I think obvious and common sense … he doesn’t want to go on and on and on like Mrs Thatcher,’ the Mayor said. ‘To say he’s arrogant or presumptuous to rule [out] a third term seems to be totally bizarre because actually he’s being rather humble and rather straightforward and telling it like it is.’ Asked repeatedly if he would go for the party leadership, Mr Johnson said: ‘I can’t possibly answer that because it’s a long way off. We probably don’t even know the identity of the next leader … It is some baby, unborn.’ Mr Osborne praised Mr Cameron for giving ‘a direct answer’. Mrs May is yet to comment. But the recent turnaround in his popularity as the economy improves has led many MPs to reconsider. Polls suggest Mr Osborne has become the most popular Conservative Treasury spokesman since Nigel Lawson in 1987. ‘Cameron has propelled George Osborne into the top three, quite deliberately,’ said one senior MP. ‘Whether that helps George or not remains to be seen.’ Another former minister said: ‘It’s not what he has said about timing – it’s the list of names. The Parliamentary party doesn’t really want any of them. Theresa May is a cold loner with a following of about two. George has been a good Chancellor of the Exchequer, but people resent his coterie of apparatchiks and think he is ultimately unelectable. Boris is another Bullingdon Club boy who ignored Parliament when he was last in it and lots of people think would be too risky.’ MPs also questioned how Mr Cameron could promise to serve a ‘full second term’ when a new leader would need at least six months to establish themselves before the 2020 election. Some allies of the Prime Minister, however, suggest he could step down as party leader, allowing a contest to take place some months before, while remaining Prime Minister right up until polling day. While this would be unprecedented in modern British political history, it would mirror the American system, where a president serves a fixed second term. Former Tory minister Michael Portillo described Mr Cameron’s announcement as ‘bizarre’. He told the BBC: ‘When you play chess you have to consider the next two moves, and I don’t think he did. There is no point setting off on this wild goose chase in the middle of an election campaign.’ But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon defended the Prime Minister. ‘He made very clear he is standing for a full second term. What happens in 2020 really, I think, doesn’t bother a lot of people,’ he said. ‘If he had said exactly the opposite – that he wanted to go on and on and he wasn’t prepared to answer the question when he was likely to finish – you’d have accused him, quite rightly, of arrogance and wanting term after term.’ A snap poll by ComRes for the Daily Mail found voters are divided over Mr Cameron’s announcement. Some 70 per cent believe Mr Cameron was ‘just being honest’, while 80 per cent say ten years is long enough for any Prime Minister to achieve their plans. Four in ten said he had made himself a lame duck, but the majority – 59 per cent – disagreed. However, 70 per cent said he should be focusing on voters rather than his own job. Four in ten think the next government would be destabilised by a Tory leadership election.",

A photo of nurse Gary Harris next to Marjan Holbrook and her daughter Rebecca was uploaded to Facebook by Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

'Heavy rain at the starting line almost kept them from participating, but nurse Gary, who they had met in the hospital a few weeks earlier, spotted them and their predicament.

Care: Harris earlier was a nurse for 8-year-old Rebecca, who has mitochondrial disease, at an Atlanta hospital. The girl's mother, Marjan Holbrook, is seen right in the Publix Georgia 5K . 'So, the man who had cared for Rebecca offered to push her through the tough course so mom could run alongside them. 'In the end, not only did all three successfully complete the race, Rebecca and Gary finished first in their division! The 5K race is part of the Publix Georgia Marathon and Half Marathon. WSB-TV, which first reported on the story and Facebook post, said rainy and chilly weather can irritate Marjan Holbrook's asthma. Under cold weather, seizures often hit eight-year-old Rebecca, the television station reported. Marjan Holbrook recalled the Sunday events to WSB-TV, saying 'I was about to call [my husband as he was parking] and say \"Don’t bother, I’m not going to run.\" It was getting stressful.' According to MitoAction, 'Mitochondrial disease is a chronic, genetic disorder that occurs when the mitochondria of the cell fail to produce enough energy for cell or organ function.' No cure exists for the disease, which can get worse over time, according to the organization. Some of the symptoms include muscle weakness, seizures, having autism or being on the spectrum, as well as learning disabilities and developmental delays, the group says. Health concerns: Marjan Holbrook and Rebecca were going to opt out of the race before Harris offered to help them, since cold weather can irritate Marjan's asthma and her daughter can get seizures in chilly temperatures . Endurance: Nurse Gary Harris, seen left with Rebecca Holbrook, has said he celebrated finishing the 5K before running to his wife's spot in the half marathon so they could finish at the same time . Marjan Holbrook told WSB-TV  that while at tent for theKyle Pease Foundation '[Gary] came over and said hi and I said, \"Gary, it’s good to see you, but I don’t think we’re going to be running this morning.\"' The television station reported that Harris then volunteered his assistance before the group went on to run the 5K in 27 minutes. Marjan Holbrook told the  station 'I’m inspired by Gary because he wasn't supposed to be there. He hadn't trained, but he just showed up and did it.' Harris told WSB-TV that he and his wife annually participate in the Publix Georgia Half Marathon.

        "input_text": "Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, the enlisted U.S. soldier who left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was later ransomed from an Islamist extremist network by the Obama administration for five Taliban leaders, was charged with desertion and 'misbehavior before the enemy' buy the U.S. Army on Wednesday. But he won't face the death penalty if a military court martial finds him guilty of 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty.' The level of that charge the Pentagon levied on him carries a maximum of just a 5 year prison term. The other charge, however, 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place,' could send him to a military prison for life. The Uniform Code of Military Justice describes examples of that crime as running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . CHARGED: An Army officer announced the formal criminal complaint against Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Wednesday . Bergdahl, a US Army sergeant who was swapped in 2014 for five high-value Taliban leaders, has been charged with desertion and will face a military court martial, according to reports on Wednesday . President Barack Obama announced the return of Bergdahl on May 31, 2014 in a White House Rose Garden press event as the soldier's parents Jani (left) and Bob (right) looked on . SOLDIER: Bergdahl was an Army private when he was captured, but the Pentagon restored his rank upon his release to what it would have been – sergeant – if he had remained on active duty, and paid him more than $200,000 in back wages . In addition to a potential life sentence, punishments for the crimes Bergdahl was charged with include a dishonorable discharge from the Army, a reduction in rank all the way down to 'E-1' – the lowest level of enlisted personnel – and forfeiture of all of his military pay. An Army spokesman said in a hastily scheduled press conference at Fort Bragg in North Carolina that the next step in the procedure would be an 'article 32' hearing at Fort Sam Houston in Texas. That's where Bergdahl remains on active duty, and will remain unless he's convicted. An article 32 hearing is analogous to a grand jury in the civilian court system. Its purpose is determine if there is enough evidence for a formal court martial. Bergdahl, 28, disappeared from his post in Paktika province, Afghanistan on June 30, 2009 after tellign comrades that he had grown cynical about America's mission there. The Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based network of Islamists aligned with the Taliban regime, took him prisoner and held him for nearly five years. A deal brokered by the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar brought him home, but at the cost of releasing the Taliban insurgents from the military prison complex at Guantanamo, Cuba. Two of them have recently said they are eager to rejoin the fight against the West when their Qatar-imposed year of restrictions and monitoring is over. A government official meanwhile told Fox News that three of the men have already tried to 're-engage' with their old networks, and one was 'trying to provide advice, council or inspiration' to his former terror network. Bowe Bergdahl will face charges under articles 85 and 99 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . 'Desertion with Intent to Shirk Important or Hazardous Duty': . Article 85 charges a soldier with desertion if he 'quits his unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.' It can carry a death sentence but the military won't seek that option in the Bergdahl case . MAXIMUM SENTENCE: 5 years in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . 'Misbehavior Before the Enemy by Endangering the Safety of a Command, Unit or Place': . Article 99 charges a servicemember with running away from a fighting enemy, throwing down his weapons, abandoning his platoon or other fighting unit, or otherwise purposely failing 'to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy.' MAXIMUM SENTENCE: life in a military prison plus reduction in rank, dishonorable discharge and forfeiture of pay . The Pentagon was set to announce a decision in the case Wednesday afternoon at Fort Bragg, N.C., but the White House insisted it was in the dark. 'I'm not aware of any plans for them to do that,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during his daily press briefing, after Daily Mail Online asked him for comment on the looming Pentagon press conference. 'But this is a process that's being run by the United States Army,' Earnest added. 'So I'd direct you to the Pentagon for an answer.' A Pentagon official confirmed the charges in advance of the announcement. House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican, said in a statement after the Army's announcement that 'every American is innocent until proven guilty, and we all wanted to bring Sgt. Bergdahl home.' 'But my chief concern remains President Obama’s decision to release five hardened terrorists, with no guarantees that they won’t return to the battlefield. I believe it made Americans less safe.' Bergdahl's case has seen a series of shifts in administration policy, but charging him with a potentially capital offense would represent a stunning 180-degree turn. Last year after Bergdahl came home, National Security Adviser Susan Rice claimed he had served his country 'with honor and distinction.' But in the days before his then-mysterious disappearance in 2009, he wrote an email to his parents spelling out his disillusioned thoughts. 'The future is too good to waste on lies. And life is way too short to care for the damnation of others, as well as to spend it helping fools with their ideas that are wrong,' he wrote, according to Rolling Stone magazine. 'I have seen their ideas and I am ashamed to even be American.' Bergdahl's father reportedly responded with an email whose subject line read: 'OBEY YOUR CONSCIENCE!' The Fox News Channel reported in 2014 that Bergdahl's platoonmates found a note in his tent telling them that he had left to start a new life – and that he intended to renounce his citizenship. 'TALIBAN FIVE': The terror leaders traded for Bergdahl were (top, from left): Abdul Haq Wasiq, Khirullah Said Wali Khairkhwa, Mohammad Nabi Omari; and (bottom from left): Mohammad A Fazl, Mullah Norullah Noori . PROOF OF LIFE: Bergdahl's captors released a video on July 19, 2009 showing him with his head shaven, and showing his military 'dog tag' ID to the camera . Gen. Mark Milley, the commanding officer at Fort Bragg, has been leading the inquest into the Bergdahl case. The U.S. Army's decision to send the desertion case to a court martial signals that military prosecutors believe they can prove Bergdahl never intended to return to his combat unit. Desertion itself can carry a death sentence, but only in the most serious of cases. That penalty hasn't been levied on a U.S. servicemember since 1944. The Pentagon has broad discretion and can charge soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen with desertion on a variety of different levels. Bergdahl's attorney spoke to reporters in advance of the Pentagon's announcement. The Washington Post reported that Eugene Fidell, Bergdahl's attorney, said his client was handed his 'charge sheet' Wednesday at Fort Bragg. President Barack Obama attracted scorn when the prisoner swap was announced, especially from Bergdahl's former platoonmates – who insisted he deserted them and their mission. One of them, Cody Full, told a congressional committee in June 2014 that Bergdahl could – and should – be court martialed on eight separate charges, including disobeying orders and 'misconduct' as a prisoner. BALLET BOWE: Bergdahl was a classical dancer from the age of 16 or 17, studying at the Sun Valley Ballet School before he enlisted in the Army . SWAP: The Army opened an investigation into Bergdahl's 'capture' almost immediately after his release, shown here in a still frame from a video of the prisoner exchange (Bergdahl is 3rd right, back to the camera) TEMPORARY: Jubilant signs and American flags went up overnight in the Bergdahls' hometown of Hailey, Idaho – but were largely taken down as the circumstances of Bowe's capture made the news. Most of the backlash against the president, however, came from Congress – which wasn't given 30 days' notice about the 'Taliban 5' being transferred out of Guantamo Bay. A federal law requires such notice. The House of Representatives later approved a resolution condemning Obama for breaking the law, with 22 Democrats breaking ranks to agree. 'By setting free five top Taliban commanders from U.S. custody, the Obama administration made Americans less safe,' Speaker John Boehner said then. Obama defended his actions in a June 2014 joint press conference in Brussels, Belgium with British Prime Minister David Cameron, just a few days after Bergdahl was released into U.S. custody. 'I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents,' the president said then, 'and that the American people understand that this is somebody's child and that we don't condition whether or not we make the effort to try to get them back.' 'We had a prisoner of war whose health had deteriorated, and we were deeply concerned about [him],' Obama told reporters about Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. 'And we saw an opportunity and we seized it. And I make no apologies for that.' Administration officials told senators that they were kept out of the loop on the hostage swap because the Taliban threatened to kill Bergdahl if information about the negotiations was leaked. Separately, the parents of an Army lietenant who died while searching for Bergdahl months after he walked away from his platoon told Daily Mail Online that the Pentagon 'lied' to them about the circumstances of their son's death. Second Lieutenant Darryn Andrews perished in September 2009, and his commanders first said he was blown up while hunting a Taliban commander. Once Bergdahl was released, they were told the truth. 'It's a big cover-up like Benghazi,' Andrews' father said three days after Bergdahl's release, 'just like everything Obama has done.'",

        "input_text": "Evidence: A terrorism expert said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's computer contained lectures by an American-born Muslim cleric suspected of being a terrorist and a writings from an al Qaida publication . A note written by Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he hid inside a boat contained themes of global jihad similar to those found in extremist materials on his computer, a terrorism expert testified Monday at his federal death penalty trial. In the note, scrawled in pencil and carved in wood on the inside walls of the boat, Tsarnaev condemned U.S. actions in Muslim countries and asked Allah to make him a 'shaheed,' a martyr, said Matthew Levitt, a terrorism expert at The Washington Institute, a think tank that focuses on U.S. policy in the Middle East. Levitt said many of the ideas included in Tsarnaev's note are contained in lectures by Anwar al-Awlaki — an America-born Muslim cleric suspected of being a terrorist and killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011 — and writings in the al-Qaida publication Inspire magazine, both of which were found on Tsarnaev's computer. In one Inspire article shown to the jury, titled 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,' the instructions say a pressure cooker 'should be placed in crowded areas and left to blow up' and 'More than one of these could be planted to explode at the same time.' Two pressure-cooker bombs were planted by Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, near the finish line of the 2013 marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev made it clear in the note he wrote in the boat that the brothers saw the attack as retaliation for U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died three days after the bombings following a shootout with police and being run over by Dzhokhar during an escape. Dzhokhar was found more than 18 hours later hiding in a boat parked in a yard in Watertown. During opening statements, Tsarnaev's lawyer acknowledged that he participated in the bombings but portrayed Tamerlan, 26, as the mastermind who recruited his younger brother, then 19, to help him. Tsarnaev's lawyers have made it clear they are using both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial to try to save him from the death penalty. Prosecutors are expected to rest their case in the guilt phase this week. The same jury will then decide whether he spends the rest of his life in prison or receives the death penalty. Materials: One Inspire article shown to the jury was titled 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom' Writings in the al-Qaida publication Inspire magazine (pictured) were found on Tsarnaev's computer . Levitt, testifying for prosecutors, said the themes in Tsarnaev's note are common in the global jihadi movement. In one part of the note, Tsarnaev wrote, 'We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.' 'It's the idea that if you hurt one Muslim in any part of the world, it's incumbent upon a Muslim ... to do something about it,' Levitt said. Levitt was expected to be cross-examined Tuesday by Tsarnaev's lawyers. Earlier Monday, one of Tsarnaev's lawyers aggressively questioned an FBI agent about extremist materials found on Tsarnaev's computer as the defense attempted to portray Tamerlan as more radicalized and primarily responsible for the 2013 attack. Trial: One of Tsarnaev's lawyers questioned an FBI agent about extremist materials found on Tsarnaev's computer as the defense attempted to portray Tamerlan as more radicalized and primarily responsible for the 2013 attack . During opening statements, Tsarnaev's lawyer acknowledged that he participated in the 2013 bombings but portrayed Tamerlan, 26, as the mastermind who recruited his younger brother, then 19, to help him. Kevin Swindon, a supervisory agent in charge of the Boston FBI's cybersquad, last week described a variety of extremist content found on Tsarnaev's computer. During cross-examination Monday by defense attorney William Fick, Swindon acknowledged that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's computer had encryption software on it, but Dzhokhar's computer did not, an apparent attempt by the defense to suggest that Tamerlan had something to hide. While questioning Swindon, Fick also suggested that much of the activity on Dzhokhar's computer centered on Facebook and other subjects of interest to teenage boys, including popular music and homework. As part of one of his questions, Fick said there was nothing about 'jihad' or 'Islam' among the top search terms on Dzhokhar's computer.",

New surveillance footage has now emerged of her the night after her disappearance. Janina Vasquez, 27, known to loved ones as Nina, left the home she shares with her mother, Jennie Cochran, and stepfather in Overland Park, Missouri, on the night of February 11. At 10 p.m. that night she texted her stepfather and told him that she was going to stay the night with 'Allen and Nicole' and would be back the next day. The first mystery is the identity of Allen and Nicole – Vasquez’s mother had not heard of them before. Surveillance footage released by the Kansas City Police Department shows Janina Vasquez at the Isle of Capri Casino on February 12. She left the casino at 7:40 p.m. in a red car with an unknown driver . Vasquez left home on the night of February 11 and texted her stepfather telling him that she was going to stay the night with 'Allen and Nicole' and would be back the next day . The following day Vasquez was seen on the new surveillance footage leaving the Isle of Capri Casino at approximately 7:40 p.m. Detectives say she got into a red car driven by an unknown person, and they want to speak with that driver or anyone who saw her get into the car. No one saw or heard from Vasquez again until the discovery of her body in a 25 feet deep flood control well at Richard Berkley Riverfront Park  on February 19. Scroll down for video . The park is immediately next to the casino on the banks of the Missouri River and a heritage trail links the two. She was found wearing the gray Victoria Secret sweatsuit she was last seen in, but the jacket was tied around her waist despite the weather being so cold during the eight days she was missing. Her cell phone was in one of her burgundy boots and her ID was found in the other, but her bra, underwear and socks, and the burgundy North Face backpack she was carrying are all missing. The park itself is one mile from where her cell phone last pinged a signal tower, on February 12 – at the intersection of Third and Cherry streets, approximately a mile and a half from the casino. Vasquez was found dead in a flood control well behind a locked gate in a city park. She was wearing the gray sweatsuit she is seen wearing in surveillance footage, but with no underwear and the top tied around her waist . The well where Vasquez's body was found is in a remote part of the Richard Berkley Riverfront Park on the Missouri River a short walk from the casino . Vasquez was found with a severe injury to the back of her head that would have killed her almost instantly. Both of her wrists were also fractured. Added to the mystery is that Vasquez suffered from seizures and post-traumatic stress disorder and took several pain and anxiety medications at the time of her death. She therefore does not drive and could not have walked to the park. Someone had to have picked her up. It also would have been close to impossible for Vasquez to get inside the security fence that surrounds the well, let alone lift the heavy grate on top of it. Vasquez is described as creative, a hippie-type that named her dog Ziggy Marley, and who would paint to help relieve her health issues. ‘It’s been a nightmare; just that area and knowing that she was cold and frozen and alone,’ Cochran told Fox 4. ‘Obviously she got mixed up [with] somebody, something happened.’ ‘Who was she with between February 11 and February 19 and why was she in that park? Who took her to the park? We’re not getting these answers,’ said Cochran. Anyone with information can call the KCPD Homicide Unit at (816) 234-5043 or the TIPS Hotline at (816) 474-TIPS.

The defense admitted during opening statements that Tsarnaev participated in the bombings, but Tsarnaev's lawyer said he was a troubled 19-year-old who had fallen under the influence of his radicalized brother, Tamerlan, 26.

The defense has made it clear from the beginning of the trial that its strategy is not to win an acquittal for Tsarnaev but to save him from the death penalty. If the jury convicts Tsarnaev — an event that seems a foregone conclusion because of his admitted guilt — the same jury will be asked to decide whether he should be executed or spend the rest of his life in prison. During its brief case, the defense called a cell site analyst who showed that Tsarnaev was at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth when Tamerlan purchased components of the two bombs used in the 2013 attack, including pressure cookers and BBs. They also called Mark Spencer, a digital forensics expert, who testified about Tamerlan’s computer history and his fascination with jihadist literature and learning how to construct bombs. Tsarnaev's lawyer told jurors that it was Tamerlan who shot and killed MIT police Officer Sean Collier three days after the bombings. Tamerlan died after a gun battle with police hours after Collier's slaying. An FBI photographer was also called in hopes of showing that Tsarnaev did not target specific individuals with the bombs. FBI fingerprint examiner Elaina Graff was the fourth witness, who testified that Tamerlan's prints were found on a transmitter, a pressure cooker lid, a jar of nails, a caulking gun, rolls of duct tape and a soldering iron, and Tsarnaev's prints were found on just on a container of gunpowder found near the scene of his shootout with police.

Republican leaders are warning other countries to 'proceed with caution' in negotiations with the Obama administration because any deal could be later undone, however. President Barack Obama lacks the . political and legal backing to commit the United States to an . international agreement, they say. Republican leaders are warning other countries to 'proceed with caution' in negotiations with the Obama administration because any deal could be later undone . The White House's Tuesday announcement that the U.S. would cut greenhouse gas emissions by close to 28 percent from 2005 levels within a decade builds on a promise Obama made last November in Beijing in concert with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The two countries are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gasses. To meet its stated benchmark by 2025, the White House will rely on a host of existing laws and executive actions targeting power plants, vehicles, oil and gas production and buildings. 'We can achieve this goal using laws that are already on the books, and it will be in place by the time the president leaves office,' Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the president, said according to the New York Times. Obama has just two years remaining in office, but many of the Senate's Republican lawmakers who oppose the initiative will remain in positions of power long after the current president has moved on. 'Considering that two-thirds of the U.S. federal government . hasn't even signed off on the Clean Power Plan and 13 states . have already pledged to fight it, our international partners . should proceed with caution before entering into a binding, . unattainable deal,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted on Tuesday. The UN Climate Conference is to take place from Nov. 30 to Dec. 11. U.S. officials stressed that their Intended Nationally . Determined Contribution, U.N. lingo for its official submission, . stands on sound legal footing, with the measures drawing . authority from legislation such as the Clean Air Act and the . Energy Independence and Security Act. Todd Stern, the lead U.S. climate change negotiator, said he . frequently tells foreign counterparts that 'undoing the kind of . regulation we are putting in place is very tough to do.' But elements of the administration's climate policy already . face legal challenges. On April 16, a federal appeals court in . Washington, D.C. will hear arguments from 13 states opposed to . as-yet-unfinalized regulations from the Environmental Protection . Agency (EPA) that target emissions in existing power plants. McConnell's warnings echoed the tone of a March 9 'open . letter' from 47 Republican senators to Iran, in which they . warned a Republican president would not be bound to honor a . nuclear agreement struck by Democrat Obama without congressional . approval, calling it a 'mere executive agreement.' So did Missouri Senator Roy Blunt's. Blunt holds the position of vice chairman in the Senate Republican Conference. 'Just as we witnessed throughout recent negotiations with Iran and during the previous climate agreement with China, President Obama and his administration act as if Congress has no role in these discussions,' Blunt said in a Tuesday statement. 'That’s just flat out wrong.' 'We will not stand by and allow the president to unilaterally enact bad energy policies that hurt our nation’s poorest families and young people the most,' he said. The White House's Tuesday announcement that the U.S. would cut greenhouse gas emissions by close to 28 percent from 2005 levels within a decade builds on a promise Obama made last November in Beijing in concert with Chinese President Xi Jinping . Some observers said that resistance to the administration's . climate policies leaves foreign governments questioning whether . Obama's commitments can last. 'By strenuously invoking EPA regulations, the Administration . is trying to convince skeptical international audiences that the . U.S. can actually deliver on its new climate goals, despite . Republican resistance,' said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton . White House official who is now with the German Marshall Fund of . the United States. 'But major capitals are likely to remain nervous.' The administration is clearly sensitive to the threat. Power . plants are the biggest domestic source of greenhouse gas . emissions, and the EPA is seeking to use its power to slash . carbon levels from plants to 30 percent of their 2005 levels by . 2020. On Monday, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the agency . had designed power plant rules under the authority of the Clean . Air Act - and insisted that they can withstand Supreme Court . scrutiny. 'We don't need a plan B if we are solid on our plan A,' she . said. Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer representing utilities . industries for Bracewell & Giuliani and former assistant . administrator of the EPA under George W Bush, says even if the . courts uphold the EPA proposal on power plants, a future . Republican administration can reverse it. 'There are some EPA rules that are very difficult for a new . administration to change but this is not one of those rules,' Holmstead said. He calculates that at least five high court . justices are wary of the EPA's regulatory leeway. Environmental groups, on the other hand, were more confident . that Obama's measures cannot be reversed by the courts or . politics. 'The Clean Air Act has proven to be quite durable,' said . David Waskow, director of international initiatives for the . World Resources Institute. 'While elements may be slowed or . modified by legal challenges, they are rarely overturned.'",

'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented this was because the Clintons had begun 'marginalizing the president' and that they were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' Because of this she reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, President Obama and Michelle Obama had Clinton in for a meeting and reportedly told her in no uncertain words that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She’s promised O’Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' said a source. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016 . She has also reportedly reached out to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary . Edward Klein, the author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' It seems like it is not over yet either, as there are reportedly six more probes currently going on that are looking into Clinton's performance. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, discussing it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' said Klein. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama’s longest serving advisers and closest confidantes, and said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'",
        "summary": "A new report claims that Valerie Jarrett, one of President Barack Obama's top advisers, leaked the Hillary Clinton email scandal to the press .\nWhat's more, the leak was reportedly planned to hit at the same time Clinton planned to announce her run for presidency .\nThe New York Post claims that Jarrett was angry that the Clintons had been working to 'marginalize' President Obama .\nJarrett reportedly blamed the Clintons for the fact that members of the party refused to campaign with Obama during the midterm elections .\nThere are reportedly six more probes going on investigating Clinton and more leaks are expected .\nPresident Obama reportedly told Clinton in a meeting with Jarrett and the First Lady that he would not support her in the presidential primary ."

        "input_text": "Not many people were more excited for the first day of spring - weather in sync or not - than Jillian Tenen. The 29-year-old events planner moved to Boston from Florida two years ago and doesn't have any family in town. When the first of many record-breaking snowfalls dumped down on the city in January, Tenen was sick with the flu, and didn't dig out her 2007 Honda Civic. Only the snow didn't stop, and the street plows only pushed more mounds in and around where her car was parked in Bay Village. By the time Tenen got her shovel out, it was all-but too late. 'I'm 5' 2,' and it was all ice, an iceberg on top of my car,' Tenen told The Boston Globe. 'I couldn't reach it. I couldn't lift it. And even if I could, there was nowhere to put it. I just didn't know what to do.' After a few laughs, quite a lot of tears, and at lease one breakdown, Tenen realized she had no choice but to abandon her car until winter passed. It's under the iceberg: Jillian Tenen was sick with the flu during the first big snow of winter in Boston in winter, and after failing to dig out her car, it ended up under this mountain of snow on Isabella Street in the Bay Village neighborhood . There it is: Recently, some of the 'iceberg' began to clear and the car - or at least its shape - became a little more clear . Not again: But with this winter being Boston's snowiest ever, the heavens kept opening and the car kept getting buried . Bleak: Jillian Tenen's car is seen parked on Isabella Street in Boston on February 23, 2015. Winter 2015 yielded the largest record snowfall in the city of Boston's history . Clearing up: Jillian Tenen's car went through weeks of storms and melting snow, staying frozen in place at the same on-street parking spot . Almost there: By last week - March 12 - and after two months almost, the Honda Civic was almost ready to escape its cave . Finally!: On March 16, Jillian Tenen's was finally back on the road, seven weeks after it was first snowed in . Yay! All-smiles, Jillian Tenen finally got behind the wheel of her car on March 18, and was shocked that it started right away . But after seven weeks, and a heap of chipping, the car has finally freed from its icy cave. Sadly not much could be done about the damage. The windscreen buckled under the weight of the snow and is all smashed up. There were also deep dents in the roof. But, surprisingly, the car started on the first go after it had thawed. Tenen said her insurance company will now assess the damage. While she hopes that future winters won't be so severe, and will plow her car diligently from now on, she learnt a valuable lesson. 'If I had to do it again, I would definitely do one thing differently,' she told The Globe. 'I would not park on the corner.' Although the storm didn't cripple Boston as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary residents . Damage: The weight of the snow and ice smashed the windscreen and dented the roof quite badly, but Tenen is filing an insurance claim . Many people in the northeastern US had to put on winter boots as Winter Storm Ultima hijacked the first official day of spring . The Brooklyn Bridge was coated with snow as New York City was hit with yet another snowstorm on Friday, March 20 . Brooklyn residents had to bundle up and deal with the cold even though Friday was the first day of spring . Spring arrived on Friday, but Winter Storm Ultima ensured that winter would have at least one more go around with snow . Snow will continue to fall in some parts of the country throughout the weekend . Winter Storm Ultima may have cause more issues for Tenen and her car on Friday. Although the storm didn't cripple the city as previous storms have, it still created a nuisance for snow-weary Boston. In the city, it's par for the course to pick up another 3 to 4 inches of snow after March 20, Weather.com reported. During the April Fools' Blizzard of 1997, 25.4 inches of snow in just 24 hours paralyzed Boston. On Friday, Ultima led to some travel advisories and early school dismissals . Weather.com meteorologist Jon Erdman said: 'While late March surface temperatures and Ultima's quick movement won't make this a blockbuster, some fairly impressive snowfall rates today will likely lead to at least a slushy afternoon commute in parts of the New York City and Philadelphia metros. The storm dumped 7.3 inches of snow in Lynnport, Pennsylvania, 6.7 inches at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey and six inches in Cascade, Maryland.",

        "input_text": "A top Hillary Clinton aide is at the center of a lawsuit filed by a government watchdog group, which claims the U.S. State Department hid emails it was required to hand over as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. On Wednesday Daily Mail Online reported that Huma Abedin, a former Clinton deputy chief of staff and a member of her inner circle, had a private address on the now-infamous email server Clinton kept at her Chappaqua, New York home and used exclusively while she was in office. One day later Judicial Watch, a center-right group known for blanketing Washington with FOIA requests, has demanded that a federal court reopen a case it agreed to drop last year because Abedin's emails were never properly searched. Chris Farrell, the group's research and investigations director, told Daily Mail Online on Thursday that nine more closed cases could be reopened in light of Clinton's email-gate scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE LEGAL PETITION . MOTHER FIGURE: Former State Department Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Huma Abedin (right) traveled with Hillary Clinton and was seen as one of her closest aides . Longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . In all, Judicial Watch has filed 18 FOIA lawsuits against the State Department, 'all of which are being carefully considered in light of Mrs. Clinton’s and the department’s misconduct and misrepresentations,' Farrell said. 'More strong legal action will follow. Stay tuned,' he added . At the time the Abedin lawsuit was wending its way through federal court, the State Department said in writing that it had exhaustively searched its archives and provided everything Judicial Watch asked for. But with the revelation of a separate email address, the group is demanding a second bite at the apple. Judge Emmit Sullivan in Washington, D.C. is expected to grant the request: Judicial Watch writes in its filing that the State Department won't fight it. State 'does not oppose reopening the case in this particular circumstance,' the legal filing says. According to federal court rules, a lawsuit can be reopened due to 'fraud, ... misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party.' In its filing, Judicial Watch wrote that the State Department 'represented to Judicial Watch that the records of the Executive Secretariat had been searched.' Tom Fitton, the group's president, said there was misconduct at the State Department and demanded 'immediate court action' 'At no point did the State Department inform Judicial Watch that the Secretary’s emails and the emails of Ms. Abedin and other high level officials could not be searched,' the court petition reads. 'These were misrepresentations.' 'Had Judicial Watch known that the State Department’s search excluded Secretary Clinton’s emails and the emails of Ms. Abedin and other high level officials, Judicial Watch would not have stipulated to the dismissal of this case.' Tom Fitton, the group's president, said Thursday in a statement that 'Hillary Clinton’s misconduct and the resulting fraud by the State Department disrupted and ended our federal FOIA lawsuit about Huma Abedin, one of Hillary Clinton’s closest political associates.' 'Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration concealed records and lied to obstruct a federal court and Judicial Watch from finding out about the secret emails,' he claimed. 'Time is of the essence. Immediate court action is imperative to retrieve, recover and secure these public records from Mrs. Clinton.' Clinton said durign a press conference on Tuesday in New York City that she had deleted more than 30,000 'personal' emails from her 'clintonemail.com' server after determining with no outside input that they were unrelated to her government work. She said nothing about other accounts on the server, including Abedin's. The Federal Records Act puts responsibility for archiving public records on the heads of government agencies – a group that included Clinton while she ran the Obama administration's State Department for four years. 'Secretary Clinton plainly violated her own legal obligations,' Judicial Watch said in a press release. 'Doing so was misconduct.' There's no indication that Thursday's legal petition was a response to Daily Mail Online's expose a day earlier. But the State Department's Office of General Counsel could soon have its hands full. The Associated Press said Wednesday that it, too had sued the agency to force the release of emails and other government documents from the years Clinton was at the helm. Some of the AP's requests and demands dated back five years. And the State Department's Office of Inspector General found this week that it had retained just 61,000 emails, out of more than 1 billion sent by the agency's employees, in 2011 – in the middle of Clinton's tenure.

        "input_text": "The Internal Revenue Service's $10.9 billion annual budget is so puny that it's ignoring 60 per cent of phone calls from people who are working on their tax return who have questions in advance of the April 15 filing deadline. John Koskinen, the agency's commissioner, said Tuesday during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. that $346 million in budget cuts this year has caused a noticeable negative impact on taxpayer service.' 'This year we were forced to substantially reduce hiring of extra seasonal help we usually bring in during the filing season,' Koskinen said. 'As a result, the phone level of service is now below 40 per cent.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . CRY POVERTY: IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told a National Press Club audience that $10.9 billion is too small a budget to guarantee that taxpayers who call with questions hear a voice on the other end of the line . 'TIS THE SEASON: Tax returns for 2014 are due on April 15 . 'That means that six out of every 10 people who call can't reach a customer service representative,' said Koskinen. 'This truly is an abysmal level of service.' Koskinen wasn't ceding new ground in Americans' hate-hate relationship with the IRS. He was arguing that Congress should give his agency more money. 'We are aware of taxpayers lining up outside some of our offices many hours before they open,' he said. 'You would think, in fact, we must be selling something like the Apple watch when you look at the lines. This is not a new story this year; it’s just gotten worse.' Overall, Koskinen complained, 'the IRS is now the lowest level of funding since 2008,' resulting in 'fewer audits and collection cases' and costing the U.S. Treasury at least $2 billion in revenue. CAN'T BE ABOLISHED: Presidential canididate Sen. Ted Cruz (pictured in New Hampshrie on March 27) has campaigned on the idea of doing away with the IRS, but Koskinen said Tuesday that it can't be done – although 'you can call it something other than the IRS if that makes you feel better' Congress has weighed that number, though, against a much larger sum of money that has gone out the door to tax fraud scammers. In 2013, the last year for which reliable numbers are available, the IRS paid out $5.8 billion in fake tax refunds to identity thieves. Law enforcement crackdowns have taken 'a lot of the amateurs off the street, but we are clearly dealing with organized crime syndicates here and around the world,' the commissioner said. And the IRS itself gets 'millions of attacks on our system every year,' he griped, due to some software packages the IRS has been using since 'when JFK was president.' 'About the only good thing you can say about them,' Koskinen joked, 'is that the code they use has been out of date for so long that it has the unintended effect of creating problems for any hackers who might try to figure out how the system actually works.' The IRS has been hammered in recent years after investigations revealed lavish spending on employee conferences for its employees, including one featuring am expensively produced Star Trek parody video. Another bone of contention among lawmakers who set Koskinen's budget has been the practice, now discontinued, of paying performance bonuses to at least 1,100 agency employees who themselves owe delinquent taxes. THE IRS, the federal government agency Americans most love to hate, has had its wings clipped by Congress following a series of spending scandals including lavish employee conferences and bonuses paid to tax cheats . Rhode Island Republican Rep. Ander Crenshaw, who chairs the congressional appropriations subcommittee that oversees the IRS, warned the commissioner this year that the House of Representatives nas taken note. 'We deliberately lowered the IRS funding to a level that will make the IRS think twice about what you are doing and why you are doing it,' Crenshaw told him, because you don’t have a single dime to spare on anything frivolous or foolhardy or even mediocre.' Tax returns for individual filers are due in two weeks, but six-month extensions are available. Still, most Americans find America's tax laws confusing enough to rely on tax-preparation software or professional preparers to help them navigate the waters, leading to frustration and now-legendary resentment. 'The IRS code is longer than the Bible,' Koskinen said Tuesday, 'with none of the good news.'",

        "input_text": "Top House Republicans are warning Hillary Clinton they won't hesitate to have her charged with criminal wrongdoing if it turns out she didn't provide the State Department with copies of every email she sent in relation to the Benghazi assault. A spokesperson for Clinton has said that the former secretary of state completely complied with the requirement but Republicans have continued to question the veracity of that statement. A House committee tasked with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in Libya issued a new round of subpoenas last week for messages sent through Clinton's personal account, which was recently revealed to be the only email address she used while at the State Department, mixing business correspondence with pleasure, all at a domain outside the immediate scope of the government. The controversy has bled into a separate review of the Clinton Foundation's fundraising practices during Hillary Clinton's tenure in Barack Obama's administration after the Washington Post discovered that her family's charity accepted money from foreign governments that were also lobbying the State Department. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Hillary Clinton, pictured here with daughter Chelsea Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative University in  Miami, Florida, didn't appear to be worried during the Saturday event about investigations into her email . Clinton and her team have kept their heads down as the scandals played out, to the chagrin of some Democrats who say that the likely 2016 presidential candidate needs to head off bad press by confronting the allegations. Collectively, the accusations of impropriety levied at the Clintons have extended into their third week, and appear to be gaining strength rather than dissipating. The email saga was a topic of discussion on multiple agenda-setting talk shows on Sunday morning, and the Clinton Foundation's fundraising again grabbed headlines. 'The emails are a related but secondary scandal,' a so-called Clinton 'loyalist' told the National Journal. 'Follow the foundation money.' The Clinton Foundation admitted last month to accepting a donation from the Algerian government in the amount of $500,000 for disaster relief in Haiti while Hillary was secretary of state and did not disclose it to the federal government. It had, at that time, an agreement with the Obama administration that allowed it to keep taking money from foreign governments it had done business with the past. But Algeria was a new donor, meaning it broke the rules when it cashed the country's check. Of importance is that Algeria was lobbying the State Department at the time and spent roughly the same amount on that effort as it gave to the then-secretary's family foundation. Bill Clinton refused on Sunday to talk about his wife's email woes, saying he had an opinion, and a bias, yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own. In a dueling appearance on CNN with Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, also of California, said on the network's State of the Union program that 'voluntary cooperation' with a House's investigation into the Benghazi attack 'does not guarantee that it's a crime not to deliver all.' 'A subpoena which Trey Gowdy issued is so that in fact it will be a crime if she knowingly withholds documents pursuant to subpoena,' Issa, a recent chairman of the House Oversight Committee said. 'He needed to do that because she wasn't forthcoming two-and-a-half years ago. She, in fact, hid the very existence of this until she was caught.' South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy called into question on Sunday a photo of Clinton on her phone that inspired the Texts from Hillary meme. 'And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip' Gowdy is the chair of the House's Select Committee on Benghazi. Schiff is the ranking Democrat on the temporary task force. Comprised of lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, the select committee has been charged by House Speaker John Boehner with investigating the events leading up to the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist strike on the U.S. consulate in Libya. Several House committees have already looked into the assault extensively, but as Issa articulated Sunday, GOP lawmakers believe investigators were not provided with all of Clinton's Benghazi associated emails and an additional review of her actions is warranted. 'And we may never get many of them because we don't know what we don't know when it's on a server where a click of the button can delete records forever,' he said, referring to reports that Clinton housed her email on a home-brewed server that only she and aides had access to. On Sunday, Schiff accused the taxpayer-funded Benghazi panel of using its power 'to become an arm of the Republican National Committee.' 'That's what happened this week,' he said of committee head Gowdy's response to the Clinton email brouhaha. 'And that is deeply disturbing, because, Michael, we have the secretary's e-mails,' Schiff continued, addressing the show's fill-in host Michael Smerconish. Pointing out that Clinton provided 55,000 pages of her correspondence to the State Department, 900 pages of which were on Benghazi, Schiff said relevant emails have already been reviewed by House investigators and 'there is nothing at all corroborative of any of these conspiracy theories.' Gowdy said on CBS' Face the Nation that 'there are gaps of months and months and months' between the email records that the House was provided . Gowdy said Sunday morning on another program, CBS' Face the Nation, that 'there are gaps of months and months and months' between the email records that the House was provided, however. 'And if you think to that iconic picture of her on a C-17 flying to Libya, she has sunglasses on and she has her handheld device in her hand, we have no e-mails from that day. In fact, we have no e-mails from that trip,' the South Carolina congressman asserted. 'So, it's strange credibility to believe that if you're on your way to Libya to discuss Libyan policy that there's not a single document that has been turned over to Congress.' The photo Gowdy referenced inspired viral sensation 'Texts from Hillary.' Until yesterday, after he made mention of it on national TV, it had been Clinton's profile picture on Twitter. It's now her background photo. Her Twit pic is now an empty avatar emblazoned with the words 'NOT-THERE.org' 'See my new profile pic to raise awareness on how far we've come in reaching equal rights for women & girls worldwide,' she said, drawing attention to a report on women's rights that her organization plans to release today. The tweet is one of just two tweets that she's sent since Wednesday, when she said on the social media platform that she wants the public to see her emails and has asked the State Department to release them. The other tweet commemorated Bloody Sunday and called on her followers to keep fighting for 'voting rights, civil rights, & human rights.' Bill Clinton refused on Sunday to talk about his wife's email woes, saying he had an opinion, and a bias, yet felt he should keep from undercutting her messaging strategy with a comment of his own . A Democratic strategist who spoke to the Washington Post, said most Democrats don't believe the the cloud of suspicion currently following Clinton is 'going to have a lot of legs.' 'But there is a level of angst and annoyance about how badly the thing has been mishandled,' the source added. A former colleague of Clinton's in the Senate, California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, implored the former New York lawmaker on Sunday to make additional public remarks on the email drama. 'From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her,' Feinstein said on NBC's Meet the Press. President Barack Obama finally broke his own silence on the matter during an interview that aired Sunday on CBS. 'I'm glad that Hillary's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed,' he said, and praised her service in his cabinet. Further backing her, he said, 'I think that the fact that she is putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need.' He also claimed to have found out about Clinton's lack of a State Department email address that automatically archives emails from the press at 'the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.' His statement follows a prediction from his spokesman on Friday that he probably 'learned about that by reading the newspaper' but wasn't entirely sure.",

        "input_text": "A Republican-led congressional committee created to look into the 2012 Benghazi, Libya terror attacks has formally asked Democratic former secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton to deliver her now-famous secret email server to a neutral third party for examination. The same committee has already subpoenaed the emails of 'close to a dozen' people who worked in the State Department for Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, the chairman of the U.S. House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said on Thursday. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, the committee's chairman, wrote to Clinton's lawyer to say he expects her to give the email server to the State Department's inspector general or another unbiased examiner for an independent determination of which emails and other records should be in the public domain – or at least archived by the government. He gave Clinton an April 3 deadline to make a decision, saying he would urge House Speaker John Boehner to take action if she ignores his request. 'Though Secretary Clinton alone is responsible for causing this issue, she alone does not get to determine its outcome,' Gowdy said in a statement. 'That is why in the interest of transparency for the American people, I am formally requesting she turn the server over.' HAND IT OVER: South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy asked Hillary Clinton's lawyer on Friday to hand over her email server to a neutral third party for analysis . NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD: Mrs. Clinton dodged talk of her presidential ambitions on Thursday but a speech organizer gave her a 'Camp David' sweatshirt anyway . 'An independent analysis of the private server Secretary Clinton used for the official conduct of U.S. government business is the best way to remove politics and personal consideration from the equation. Having a neutral, third-party arbiter such as the State Department IG do a forensic analysis and document review is an eminently fair and reasonable means to determine what should be made public.' Gowdy's committee has authority to subpoena documents and individual witnesses, but not pieces of computer hardware. That would require a criminal search warrant signed by a federal judge, and Clinton is not thought to be under investigation for any crime. The hard-charging former prosecutor had told Reuters earlier on Friday that aides to Clinton and perhaps 'aides to aides' would find themselves subpoenaed. 'We sent a subpoena to the State Department for emails from a number of individuals within the State Department, other than Secretary Clinton,' Gowdy, a Republican, said in a phone interview with the news service. Separately, pressure mounted Friday on the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with a new wrinkle in the flap over the nationality of many of its six- and seven-figure donors – many of whom, it has been revealed, have ties to foreign governments. Former President Bill Clinton had promised the Obama administration that his family philanthropy would turn down money from foreign governments themselves while his wife was secretary of state. But a Wall Street Journal investigation has established that it willingly accepted large contributions from more than a dozen foundations and companies and people who might be surrogates for overseas regimes. They included a member of the Saudi royal family, a 'Ukrainian oligarch' who once served in the nation's parliament, and many government-linked businessmen, according to the Journal. Overall, the twelve gave between $34 million and $68 million after Hillary took over the State Department. Exact numbers can't be gleaned from available documents – only ranges. The Ukrainian could be problematid for Mrs. Clinton because it involves millions from the Victor Pinchuk Foundation, run by a businessman who has been a strong advocate of his country establishing closer ties with the European Union. Pinchuk also served two terms in Ukraine's parliament. Much of his foundation's donated funds came to the Clinton Foundation while the State Department was pushing for Europe, and against Russia, as a dominant force in Ukraine. It's unclear whether the foundation flap or 'email-gate' will prove the greater irritant to Mrs. Clinton's growing presidential campaign momentum. But a New York Times report this month that she had exclusively used a personal email account for government business while the chief U.S. diplomat from 2009 to 2013 has reinvigorated the Benghazi committee's investigation into the attacks that killed U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Clinton is the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination even though she has yet to formally declare her candidacy. She has come under scrutiny from Republicans who accuse her State Department of failing to protect diplomatic personnel. Gowdy said the State Department had asked him not to disclose the names of people whose emails were sought. Gowdy, a former criminal prosecutor, insists he's not interested in Clinton's private communications, but wants to elarn if she discussed the 2012 Benghazi terror attack outside the reach of government document-retention mandates . EMAIL-GATE: Clinton has been dogged by accusations that she hid work-related emails from the State Department by relying exclusively on a private email server hosted in her home . But without their emails, he has argued, no congressional committee investigating the Benghazi attack could claim to have issued a definitive report. On Thursday Mrs. Clinton said Washington politics has become too partisan, appearing at a national meeting of camp counselors. She told the American Camp Association in her final paid speech before an expected presidential announcement that America's political class could use 'camps for adults' to foster cooperation. PRESSURE: Time magazine gave Mrs. Clinton 'devil horns' on this week's cover . Meeting organizers presented her with a gray sweatshirt emblazoned with 'Camp David' – the presidential retreat in Maryland –  but otherwise steered clear of her prospective campaign, pointing to a 'huge fun deficit' in the nation and the need for politicians of all stripes to reach across the aisle. 'We really need camps for adults,' Clinton said. 'Maybe mix it up a little bit' so Americans 'have to come together and actually listen to each other. Wouldn't that be a novel idea?' As she faces partisan criticism over the email mess, Clinton has said that although she should have used a government email account, she violated no rules. Democrats say that Benghazi has been thoroughly investigated by several congressional panels and that Gowdy's committee's efforts are politically motivated and aimed at undermining Clinton's expected presidential candidacy. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters the committee 'has spent millions of dollars; produced nothing. I think we're going to just see an ongoing attempt to investigate Hillary Clinton, whatever the subject, whether it's her emails or it's her hair or whatever it happens to be.' Gowdy spoke to Reuters on the same day Senator Charles Grassley sent letters to Secretary of State John Kerry and the State Department's inspector general asking for information on the emails of Huma Abedin, who was a top aide to Clinton. Grassley said he was probing Clinton's use of a program that let some of Clinton's allies, including Abedin, do private sector work while also working for the government. Gowdy said he was not coordinating his probe with Grassley, and rejected any suggestion that the State Department might become overworked with requests for information about Clinton and her aides. The revelations about Clinton's emails have raised questions about the State Department's email practices. ANY DAY NOW: Hillary is expected to annoucne her presidential campaign launch in a matter of weeks . Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House minority leader, predicted Republicans would keep pressure on, 'whether it's her emails or it's her hair or whatever it happens to be' Earlier on Thursday, U.S. officials said the State Department does not automatically archive the emails of its assistant secretaries of state, contradicting the department's prior public statement. Gowdy said no decisions had been made in the House of Representatives about when Clinton would be called to testify, either about her email use or about the Benghazi events. He had said earlier that he hoped to call Clinton to testify in April. On Thursday Gowdy said the slowness of responses to his requests for information from Clinton and the State Department had delayed that timetable. He said he wanted all relevant documents before she appears. The Benghazi Select Committee also subpoenaed all communications of Clinton's related to Libya this month, but neither Clinton nor the State Department have produced documents in response to the subpoenas, Gowdy said. Earlier the State Department gave the committee 300 of Clinton's emails related to Benghazi. Trey Gowdy letter to Hillary Clinton's lawyer about email server uploaded by DailyMail.com .",

        "input_text": "Celebrity chef Pete Evans was in the classroom on Thursday, teaching students about the benefits of his controversial 'Paleo Way' diet, just a day after his children's cookbook was delayed amid fears the recipes could stunt the growth of babies. His school visit comes as it was claimed negative comments about his diet are being deleted from his official Facebook page, meaning only positive and supportive feedback is published. Despite the Public Health Association of Australia expressing concerns that 'Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way' cookbook could cause the death of infants, Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes. Scroll down for video . Celebrity chef Pete Evans was in the classroom on Thursday, teaching students about the benefits of his controversial 'Paleo Way' diet . 'We had the best time this morning with the grade 5 and 6 kids cooking thai chicken cakes with cucumber, avo, lettuce and corriander,' 'Paleo Pete' posted on his Facebook page. 'We also cooked mighty meaty muffins with loadsa vegies and some chia seed and coconut puddings. Nothing I love more than seeing kids learning new skills!' On Wednesday, it was announced that the release of Evan's paleo cookbook for children had been delayed due to grave concerns about the nutritional value of recipes in the book. The cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: the Paleo Way, is the joint venture of celebrity chef and My Kitchen Rules judge Evans, a long time advocate for the paleo diet, baby-blogger Charlotte Carr and naturopath Helen Padarin. The Public Health Association of Australia said that one of the recipes- a do-it-yourself baby formula made from liver and bone broth- had the potential to stunt the growth of babies and impair development. 'In my view, there's a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,' said Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the PHAA. The criticism comes amid claims comments on Evans' Facebook page expressing negative sentiments over the paleo lifestyle are being deleted. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way, has been slammed by the Public Health Association of Australia as having the potential to stunt the growth of babies . Evans visited a school in Ballarat, Victoria, where he taught children in years five and six how to cook paleo recipes . Daria, a health professional, posted on 'Blocked by Evans' after she had comments deleted and was blocked from his official Facebook page . After accusations from readers that their feedback was being erased, a rival Facebook page called Blocked By Evans was started, where people could raise their concerns freely. There was also a Twitter hashtag #blockedbypete. Just this week, in the wake of the cookbook controversy, comments questioning the safety of the broth were removed and the posters blocked from the page. Kirstie Cubbins, 31, a stay-at-home mother, had several comments she posted about the health concerns authorities has raised removed from the page. 'I linked to a News article about it [the bone and liver broth] and pointed out what the particular concerns about the formula was, and that it was by the public health authority,' Ms Cubbins told Daily Mail Australia. 'My comments were met with being told I was not welcome on the page as I was not going to support the paleo lifestyle.' Ms Cubbins comments were deleted and she was blocked from responding, though replies to her comments were left on the page. 'I haven't even commented on Pete Evans' page before but had been aware he is prone to deleting comments and blocking people,' she said. An ironic Twitter account mocked Evans visit to the school despite the controversy surrounding the book . 'My comments were never abusive, derogatory, rude or full of swearing. They just put the factual information across about why the baby formula recipe and other recipes in the new book were dangerous to babies.' Daria, a Paediatric Occupational Therapist, had a similar experience on the page when Evans posted to his Facebook page comments linking the modern Australian diet and the rise of autism. Evans, who is currently on a national tour promoting the paleo lifestyle, has long been a passionate advocate of the diet . 'I was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder. I commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that ASD [autism spectrum disorder] has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many,' Daria told Daily Mail Australia. Daria said she was surprised to see that Evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups, including grains, and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion 'despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit, particularly in wholegrain form.' Both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page. 'I think banning and blocking people who are questioning, asking questions and discussing comments that are genuine and polite is dangerous because it creates an environment where one person controls what information is visible,' Daria said. 'Pete Evans has blocked many health professionals and professional bodies from his page. These are people who unlike him have extensive training, clinical experience and access to scientific evidence about health,' she said. 'I would think their skills would be respected by someone who wants to improve societies health. Its important to promote trust and dialogue between medical and health professionals and the public.' Publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13 . Charlotte Carr (left), the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr (centre), runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website and is a co-author of the book . Following claims in December last year that comments were being deleted from the page, three social media users launched a response page 'Blocked by Pete Evans' to address what they saw as a dangerous trend of blocking genuine discussion. Gabrielle, one of the moderators of the page, said that many people had been blocked from Pete Evan's official page, most of whom were enquiring for more information about the specifics of the diet. 'I and most of the individuals on this page where blocked for simply asking a question that challenged paleo ideology or posting a scientific journal paper link that disproved claims being made,' Gabrielle told Daily Mail Australia. 'We have been accused of being \"trolls\". However simply asking a question in a civil manner is not trolling. I have only ever commented on his page once and I was blocked,' she said. Gabrielle said that several health professionals even had their accounts 'pre-blocked'. 'A couple of dietitians who have their own blogs wrote open letters asking Pete to stop tarnishing our profession and for this they were pre blocked without even writing on his wall,' she said. 'It is very sad when someone who claims to know all the answers cannot even answer to health professionals.' Gabrielle said that she had even seen instances of 'tribe followers' asking for advice on ailments and being berated by users, or having their comments deleted. 'In the instance where a health professional has suggested they visit a doctor it is also deleted, which as you can imagine is a a great concern for the health of the individual reaching out.' Pete Evans, pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts Luke Hines (left), and Wes Carr, wife of fellow co-author Charlotte Carr, has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day . Evans, a My Kitchen Rules judge, is  a long time advocate for the paleo diet and has been outspoken . The publisher of the paleo baby cookbook, Pan Macmillan Australia, released a statement which advised that 'the publication of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way has been delayed, and not recalled as incorrectly stated by Australian Women's Weekly on March 11, 2015. The publisher will be making no further comment at this time.' Evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher Pan MacMillan, including titles Family Food and Healthy Every Day, and Carr, the wife of Australian Idol contestant Wes Carr, runs the popular Bubba Yum Yum website. Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue, and publisher Pan Macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of March 13. The Federal Department of Health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention. 'The Department of Health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes, in particular the infant formula, and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter,' the statement said. A disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors 'in good faith' the recipes will lead to a healthier life, 'relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences.' Despite this, the book has been described as 'a treasure trove of nutritional information and nourishing paleo recipes that are guaranteed to put you and your little one on the path to optimum health.'",

        "input_text": "Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen knows what it is to be desperate. He's spent the last ten years behind Indonesian bars as one of the Bali Nine, arrested in 2005 for trying to smuggle 8kg of heroin from Bali into Australia. Now, as fellow convicted drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran await word of their looming executions, the 'forgotten' Bali Nine prisoner is desperately trying to raise funds for an appeal against his own life sentence. 'No one wishes death,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I have a life sentence, that means life in Indonesia. That's death by a different means.' 'If you believe in mercy': Forgotten Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen asks for help from Indonesia . After ten years of silence behind bars, 31-year-old Nguyen has launched an online My Cause campaign in an attempt to raise money for the legal costs of his latest appeal, which will be heard with fellow prisoners Si Yi Chen and Mathew Norman. 'By the time you read this there may only be seven of us left,' Nguyen wrote in his online call for help. 'Today, as I sit in my jail cell and watch the way the Indonesian government is handling the execution of my fellow Australians, I am terrified,' he said. 'Terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.' Nguyen has penned a letter of thanks to those outside prison walls who have sent him messages of support since he spoke out, saying he is overwhelmed. 'Thanks for having faith in me. It had been a long journey,' he writes. 'The words you wrote to me was really something different. Thanks for your time also in lending a hand. Thanks for giving me a chance to prove myself. A second chance. 'For the first time, not sure how to go about, but this is me asking for help to fight an unknown system,' he writes. 'Thanks again for your time in writing encouraging comments to me. It makes me more determined.' Money raised will be used to cover costs for all three men, and any remaining funds will be donated towards legal costs of the remaining Bali Nine group, also fighting for their lives. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has penned this letter of thanks to those outside prison walls who have sent him messages of support . 'Agonisingly certain I will be next': Tan Duc Thanh Nguyan has launched an emotional plea for help with a MyCause campaign to raise funds  for his legal costs, and those of fellow Bali Nine prisoners in Indonesia . Nguyen and his family know well that another appeal could be risky. Following a previous attempt in 2006, the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty, before reducing it again to life in prison in 2008. 'For five years I appealed and never had a chance. During one appeal my sentence changed from life to death,' Nguyen writes. 'But desperation has driven me to try again. A roll of the dice – for my life.' 'Am I guilty? Yes. Am I sorry? More than anyone will ever know.' Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison . Nguyen was in Kerobokan prison with Chan and Sukumaran until last year, when he was moved to Malang prison in East Java with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens. He says the pair on death row are 'good guys.' 'They dealt with their sentence in the best possible way they could,' Nguyen says. 'The facts are there, they did help others. No one is making that up; everything said about them is true. They were good guys and have helped endlessly.' Indonesia's hard-line stance on the executions of  Chan and Sukumaran have made Nguyen fearful he and the other Bali Nine members won't be given a fair trial when it comes to the appeal. But while they are still alive, he says, 'we have hope.' This week, lawyers for Chan and Sukumaran are pushing ahead with their last-ditch appeal against the Administrative Court's decision to deny the pair an opportunity to challenge President Joko Widodo. The appeal has been adjourned until next week. The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali . Of the mood in prison in Indonesia at the moment, Nguyen says Malang is 'a different place.' 'The people are different. They are really polite and respectful and are giving me the space I need right now,' he says. 'But what's happening affects me more, because I know those two [Chan and Sukumaran] while none of these people do, so life continues as normal for them. Like nothing is happening.' Nguyen told the Daily Mail his family visit when they can, but that it's far now and hard on them financially. Asked what it's like to see his family, he says: 'it is hard to answer this.' 'I'm happy seeing them, truly I am, but it's also a reminder about the pain and problems I caused them.' Nguyen says his family, who migrated to Australia as refugees from Vietnam, have spent all their life savings on his legal costs over the last ten years and are still paying those debts. Tan Duc Than Nguyen, pictured here with fellow Bali Nine prisoners, says he has spiralled into depression watching events unfold for Chan and Sukumaran in Indonesia and is desperate for his own life . The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006 . If he were ever successful in winning a reduced prison sentence, Nguyen says there are 'so many things' he wants to do. One of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through. 'The most important to me is to fix the relationship with my family,' he says. 'I live with that regret every single morning when I wake and every night in my noisy bare jail cell as I try to sleep,' he says. 'I tell you now, there isn’t any code of honour among drug dealers and in the end it will destroy you and everyone around you.' The Bali Nine consists of nine Australians who were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of the country and into Australia . Nguyen says there are many things he took for granted growing up in Australia. 'It wasn't until my arrest that I realised the things I took for granted. Basic things as living conditions. Growing up in Australia, we are fortunate. So we truly don't know the meaning of poverty at home.' In prison, Nguyen says he is trying his best not to lose hope, waking early each day to train and box at the gym and read. He is also teaching English to other prisoners and encouraging them 'to work through their problems at the gym.' 'Also what's important for me is do is everything I can so people would never have to go through what we have by being involved in the drug trade,' he says. 'But I must say, in all honesty, even though that's what I want to do, nothing is certain in life. After more than ten years inside, nothing is the same. The world I knew once isn't the same.' The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members)",

The student was released early this morning and has not yet entered a plea to the charges. 'Contrary to early police reports, Mr. Johnson has not been accused of possessing false identification. 'Just before handcuffing him, police took Martese to the ground, striking his head on the pavement and causing him to bleed profusely from the gash on his head,' Watkins said. 'This morning he received ten stitches at the University of Virginia Medical Center. Fortunately, Martese's physical wounds are beginning to heal.' He added: 'He holds numerous leadership positions on grounds, including Vice Chair for Community Relations of the Honor Committee, Vice Polemarch of the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and a Chair of the Leadership Development Committee of the Black Student Alliance. He has no criminal record. 'As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future,' Watkins said. 'I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously. 'Please keep Martese in your prayers during this difficult time.' Though he's a college junior, Johnson is under the legal drinking age. According to Charlottesville General District Court records, Johnson was charged with obstruction of justice without force, and public swearing or intoxication. He was treated at the hospital before being released. University Vice President for Diversity and Equity Marcus L. Martin and Dean of African-American Affairs Maurice Apprey described the incident in a message to students and staff as 'appalling' and said the student's head was 'slammed into the hard pavement with excessive force.' 'This was wrong and should not have occurred,' Martin and Apprey said in a written statement. 'We view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received.' The ABC issued a statement saying that 'uniformed ABC Agents observed and approached' an unidentified individual 'after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment' about 12:45 a.m. at an area of bars and restaurants near campus known as 'the Corner.' The ABC said the unidentified individual received injuries while being arrested and was treated at a local hospital before being released. The ABC said the agents involved with the arrest are being restricted to administrative duties while a state police investigation is underway. ABC agents in Charlottesville have been accused of heavy-handed actions in the past. The state of Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement last year with a UVA student who was arrested after her purchase of water was mistaken for beer. Elizabeth Daly fled in terror outside a Charlottesville supermarket in April 2013 when her vehicle was swarmed by state ABC agents who mistook her just-purchased carton of sparkling water for beer. According to Daly's lawsuit, badges worn around the casually dressed ABC agents' necks were not clearly visible and the defendants did not verbally identify themselves as officers. Daly was charged with eluding police and assaulting a police officer after her SUV grazed two of the agents. The arrest provoked a public outcry, and the charges were dropped.",

The unidentified male driver, 44, was traveling along the snowy Grand Concourse service road near 170th Street in the Bronx on Friday evening when he swerved on to the sidewalk, police said. His green taxi struck and killed Kadeem Brown and little Tierre Clark, who were part of a group of people waiting at a bus stop.  Tierre's mother, 39, and a 55-year-old man were also hit by the cab. The grief-stricken mother, who has two older children and has not been named, is said to be in a stable condition at the borough's Lincoln Hospital, while the man is being treated for critical injuries. Crash: The New York City cab driver who killed a five-year-old girl and a 25-year-old man after mounting a curb on Friday has been stripped of his TLC license, it is reported. Above, the driver's smashed-up taxi . Earlier impact: Seconds before the incident, the driver had struck a Subaru (pictured), which was parked around 100 feet south of 170th Street, causing minor injuries to the woman driving it, police said Saturday . Now, it has emerged that the driver - who was transported to Jacobi Medical Center with minor injuries following the crash - has had his Taxi and Limousine Commission license taken away by officials. This is while 'police investigate if he was having a medical episode when he crashed' his 2007 Toyota Camry green cab into the four unsuspecting victims, authorities told the New York Daily News. It comes as Kadeem and Tierre's families have paid tribute to their deceased loved ones following the horror smash, which occurred at the bustling Grand Concourse at around 6.30pm on Friday. Speaking to the newspaper, Kadeem's mother, Macia Johnson, 53, described her late son as a 'very good, hardworking kid' who worked as a security guard, but longed to travel and be a chef. She also revealed that Kadeem's sister had wailed, 'He went out and he never came back, my brother, my poor brother!,' when she heard he had died on the sidewalk after being struck by the cab. Meanwhile, Tierre's grandmother, Liz Romani, paid tribute to her granddaughter, who  had 'loved to sing and dance' and had a particular fondness for the singer-songwriter, Mary Jane Blige.

A  man, 55, and Tierre's mother were left injured . Shocked: Witnesses reported hearing loud screams as the vehicle crashed through the bus stop in the Bronx. Ronald Luis (pictured), who saw the tragedy occur at around 6.30pm, said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming' Speaking through tears, 58-year-old Ms Romani told the newspaper: '[Tierre] would just be walking down the street and break into song, she loved whatever popular music was out.' She added that the snowy, icy conditions were no excuse for the cab driver's deadly actions. Seconds before Friday's crash, the driver had struck a Subaru, which was parked around 100 feet south of 170th Street, causing minor injuries to the woman driving it, police told CBS New York. Despite the impact, he reportedly continued driving another 100 feet or so, before jumping a curb and crashing into the group waiting at the bus stop. He finally smashed into the wall of a building. Witnesses reported hearing loud screams as the tragedy unfolded. Passerby Ronald Luis said: 'I heard a lot of people screaming, so that’s what really caught my attention. And when I looked back, that’s when I saw the car drive onto the sidewalk.' Speaking to ABC 7, the 18-year-old added: 'It was frantic, very scary, never seen anything like it.' Emergency crews arrived at the bustling Grand Concourse, where they discovered Mr Brown and Miss Clark lying unresponsive on the ground. Mr Brown, who lived nearby, was pronounced dead.

Witnesses watched in shock as medics desperately tried to revive the youngster by carrying out CPR on her small body and rushing her to hospital. But despite their best efforts, she shortly died. 'On this side they were pressing on her chest - the little girl. I’m guessing also she couldn’t breathe. I wasn’t sure,' witness Raymond Fermin told CBS, describing Mr Brown as 'already gone'.

        "input_text": "Mike Holpin, a  recovering alcoholic from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, has an unusual way of keeping track of his children. With 22 that carry his last name, 18 who don't and 'probably a few more', Mr Holpin is one of the UK's most prolific fathers with offspring aged between 37 and three. To keep track of all his children, who were born to 20 different mothers, he has had their names tattooed across his back. Scroll down for video . Prolific: Mike Holpin, 56, has 40 children with 20 different women but thinks he may have more . Although he insists that he loves all of his children, Mr Holpin is no longer in touch with some, while others were removed by social services thanks to his alcoholism and womanising. Nevertheless, he says he is a changed character who wants nothing more than to reunite his vast brood - and would like to add a few more if he can. 'I'm as fertile as sin,' he explains. 'I don't believe in contraception and I love sex.' According to Mr Holpin, his first sexual experience came aged nine but his baby-making career didn't really get underway until he got a job at a fairground in his late teens. 'Boys working on rides like that, they're only there for one reason and that's to pull women,' he reminisces. 'Good looking boys are better but funny boys are spectacular. 'You have to do some manoeuvring but me, I thought, I just want sex. I'd pat them on the rump and if they say f*** off then they're not really up for it. If they say yes, then great.' Keeping track: Mr Holpin, from Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, shows off his family tree tattoo . Reformed: Mr Holpin, a recovering alcoholic, says he is a reformed character and wants to reunite his family . Taken: Because of his alcoholism, many of his children were taken by social services and grew up in care . Although Mr Holpin has had many girlfriends, he admits to having had only six serious relationships, all of which fell victim to his ongoing battle with alcohol. His children too have suffered because of his alcoholism, with nearly all being taken into care as a result. It is, says Mr Holpin, his biggest regret. 'Due to my drinking and my womanising, most of my kids have gone through the care system,' he explains. 'It makes me feel like s*** because they've suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I'm an alcoholic. I'm still an alcoholic - I just don't practise it.' Now the reformed character is hoping to reunite his huge brood and fulfil the promise he made to each child as they were removed. 'When they went into care, I made a promise that no matter how long it took, I will get my kids home,' he says. Perfect: Mr Holpin says being reunited with his huge brood would complete him and make his life perfect . Adding: He hopes to add to his family, aged between 37 and three, in the future . 'I miss all the fun we used to have so I guess getting them back, my life will be set. My life will be perfect.' Mr Holpin also says he would like to add to his family with the help of his fiancée Diane but can't resist reminiscing about the pulling techniques he used in the past. 'There's nothing nicer than a single fellow with a baby,' he smirks. 'Sex? It's sex is all it is.  You could look like the back of a bus but sex is sex. You do doggy style if she's ugly. 'I'm only 56,' he continues. 'I'll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply. I'm doing what God wants.' Now, he says, he is a reformed character. 'I've got so much love in me for my kids, it's spilling over,' he says. 'I need them more than they need me to be honest. I can't be without them.' He also says he hopes his children will be able to forgive him, both for their upbringing in care and for his lengthy reproductive career. 'I can't make up for what I've done,' he admits. 'All I can do is be there for them now. I'll keep fighting.'",

        "input_text": "A chilling 911 call made from inside the Ohio home where a mother allegedly beheaded her three-month-old daughter has revealed the chaotic scene after the body was found. Deasia Watkins, 20, had gone to bed after allegedly decapitating her baby, Janiyah, and repeatedly stabbing her body, leaving relatives to find the girl's remains early on Monday. Watkins' aunt, who had custody of the child, made the 911 call. 'Somebody please send the police!' the aunt can be heard begging in the call, which was obtained by the Washington Post. 'My niece killed our baby! Please! Help me!' Through sobs, the woman explains she was sleeping when her adult son brought his children over to her house to be picked up for school and discovered the body. Arrested: Deasia Watkins, 20, allegedly beheaded her three-month-old daughter, Janiyah (right) on Monday. She had been ordered to keep away from the child after she was hospitalized for psychiatric problems . 'My son came in here and woke me up and said, \"Momma the baby's dead\",' she explains. Overcome with emotion, she is unable to speak and her son takes the phone. The 911 dispatcher presses him for details about what happened. 'Lady, the baby is on my mom's kitchen counter with its head smashed,' the man says. 'Can you please just send the police as fast as you can.' He adds that he does not know where his cousin - Watkins - is and pleads with the dispatcher to send police before the young woman is able to hurt herself. Trying to piece together what has happened, the dispatcher asks the man if the baby is breathing. 'Listen lady, the baby is deceased,' he says, as his mother wails in the background. When the dispatcher pushes for more details, he says bluntly: 'Look, lady. I don't want to describe the scene. The [scene] is very, very bad, alright? The little baby's head is open. Like, open open. Scene: Watkins was staying at her aunt's College Hill, Ohio home (pictured) when she allegedly murdered the baby. Police found Watkins in bed and covered in blood when they responded to her aunt's 911 call . 'I'm not going in there to touch nothing, because I don't want to mess nothing up. I'm not going in there to look, because I've already seen it. But it's very violent. It's a very violent scene.' Police arrived at the College Hill home to find the decapitated baby. The child had been stabbed 15 times and had a fractured arm, and the knife had been placed in her hand. Watkins was found covered in blood and asleep in a bedroom and was arrested for aggravated murder. She was taken to hospital for mental evaluation. Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said that Watkins, who is under guard at Deaconess Hospital, is not talking to authorities. 'She's like a zombie,' he told WCPO. 'We're hoping to get her some medication so she can begin talking. 'Until she gets in front of some doctors and talks, it's going to be very difficult to know what her motivation was. No matter what the motivation was, no one is going to be able to explain this.' The horrific killing came after Watkins had been forbidden to have contact with the child after she was hospitalized for psychiatric problems, authorities said. Shock: Janiyah's father, James Brown, said his girlfriend started acting differently a month after the baby's birth. He had also been ordered to keep away from the child, who authorities said was neglected . Friend Chris Gulley, pictured, was at the couple's apartment in January when Watkins wouldn't stop screaming or talking about the devil. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis . But the aunt had apparently let Watkins move in with her and the baby a week earlier. Authorities were unaware of this because they could not constantly monitor the home, Deters said. Watkins gave birth to her daughter in December. James Brown, who authorities believe to be the baby's father, told WCPO he had been dating Watkins for two years but about a month after the birth of the child, she 'just started acting different'. He said she had been 'acting crazy lately, speaking of demons', according to a court document. She was hospitalized when police responded to a report of her screaming and the baby crying at their apartment on January 24, according to documents. In a 911 call, a neighbor tells a dispatcher: 'There's an infant screaming and then the mom's yelling at the baby, telling it to shut up... it's been going on for about an hour,' WCPO reported. Watkins appeared to be under the influence of marijuana and refused to let go of the child, court documents said. But Janiyah was taken by emergency personnel after Watkins passed out. Friend Chris Gulley was also at the apartment at the time and told WCPO that Watkins was calling him and Brown the devil. Victim: Authorities found the mother had placed the knife in baby Janiyah's hand after killing her on Monday . Tragedy: Janiyah also had multiple stab wound to her face and a broken arm, authorities have said . 'She kept saying we were sinning so much, we didn't realize we were sinning,' Gulley said. 'We need to come to the light and see what God wanted us to do and all that.' She was hospitalized briefly and diagnosed with postpartum psychosis. Doctors declared her unsafe around the child unless she took prescribed medication, court documents state. On March 6, a juvenile court magistrate the girl to be taken from her mother for the child's protection and placed in the custody of Hamilton County Job and Family Services. Brown, whose paternity has not been established, was also ordered to stay away from the child when the court found both parents neglectful. Deters said at the press conference on Tuesday that family services had done their jobs 'but you don't have the resources to be in the house 24/7'. He added that he wasn't sure anyone else would be charged. The aunt may be needed as a witness, he said. WCPO reported that Watkin's only previous brush with the law was a fine for disorderly conduct.",

        "input_text": "President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' Attorney General Eric Holder has openly endorsed automatic voter registration, adopted two days ago by Oregon, the first American state to officially embrace the measure, but Obama had not made his support for either that or compulsory voting clearly known until today. President Barack Obama lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the United States on Wednesday, saying it could prove to be a short-term solution to the excessive amount of money that's now spent on elections in the country . The president said the people in America who 'tend not to vote' are usually younger, of lower income and skew toward 'immigrant groups' and minority groups. 'And they're often the folks who are scratchin' and climbin' to get into the middle class,' he said, 'and they're working hard.' 'There's a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls,' he said. 'We should wanna get them into the polls.' The remark as a subtle reference to Republican efforts at the state level to pass legislation that would require registered voters to prove that they are who they say that they are at the polls with a government-issued photo identification card. Republicans say that such measures prevent voter fraud. Democrats claim that they stop legitimate voters from exercising their constitutional right to participate in the electoral process. Many Democrats believe that's the point of the laws - to keep groups that traditionally vote Democrat, especially minorities, from casting a ballot - and have characterized voter ID laws as racist for that reason. Requiring the elderly, who sometimes don't drive, and minorities, who when they live in major cities often take public transportation, as well as the low-income sector of society, which can't afford always afford government identification cards, is a modern day poll tax, Democrats have argued. Supporters of the photo ID laws have tried to assuage their concerns by setting aside funds for government-funded ids and offering free rides to the DMV in certain states. Obama's Department of Justice has taken many of the states that have passed such laws to court, with the notable exception of Virginia, which put in place processes to counteract the hardship that the new requirement places on certain individuals. 'It would be transformative if everybody voted. That would counteract money more than anything,' Obama told a group of Cleveland, Ohio, residents. 'If everybody voted, then, it would completely change the political map in this country.' The president is seen here mingling with guests of the event at The City Club of Cleveland . Conservatives are opposed to mandatory voting and automatic registration for many of the same reasons they believe states should adopt stricter regulations at the polls. In Oregon, also the first state in the U.S.to conduct its elections entirely by mail-in ballot, Republicans worry that the mass distribution of millions of ballots by mail, which can easily be tampered with in residential areas, creates an opening for new instances of voter fraud. Millions of ballots will be sent out and the state has little control over where they end up. The cost of implementing the law is also of concern, as the system will ensure that every Oregon resident receives a ballot unless they opt-out. There's also the question of where the DMV can ensure that the personal information it will use to pre-register voters and contact them will remain private. Automatic registration is popular in foreign countries, including Sweden, Argentina and Canada, where it has helped bring the voter participation rate up above 90 percent but remains controversial domestically. Comparatively, just over half the U.S. population regularly votes. Roughly 56 percent of eligible Americans cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election. Australia, which enforces mandatory voting, has a 100 percent rate of participation. President Barack Obama tours Magnet at Cleveland State University before his speech on Wednesday afternoon. Obama brought up the topic of compulsory voting while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics . Speaking at the The City Club of Cleveland today, Obama brought the subject up on his own while giving a long-winded response to an audience member's question about what can be done to resolve the 'dysfunction' in Washington and lead to overturn of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics. 'I don't think I've ever said this publicly, but I'm going to say it now,' Obama said, before bringing up compulsory voting. 'We shouldn't be making it hard to vote, we should be making it easier to vote,' he said. Recalling his recent speech in Selma for the 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday,' Obama said his Justice Department is 'vigorously' enforcing rights. 'The notion that this day and age we would deliberately be trying to restrict the franchise makes no sense,' he said, indirectly knocking conservatives. 'In Australia and some other countries there's mandatory voting,' the president, a trained Constitutional lawyer, added, saying moments later that it 'may end up being a better strategy in the short-term' to dealing with franchise issues. He followed up the remark by saying that 'long-term I think it would be fun to have a constitutional amendment process about... how our financial system works.' After the smattering of applause died down, he said that realistically, though, that would be a long-term proposition. President Obama holds a bottle of whiskey as he talks with Tom Lix, of Cleveland Whiskey, during a tour of the Manufacturing Advocacy & Growth Network (MAGNET) on Wednesday afternoon . Minutes before, in response to the man's original question, Obama had said he thinks the 'almost unlimited' amount of money that is spent on American political campaigns is, in his opinion 'bad for our democracy.' 'And I speak as somebody who has raised a lot of money,' he said, humble bragging. 'I'm very good at it.' Obama said he was 'proud' of the fact that his presidential campaigns 'refined' the use of the Internet for small-dollar donations. 'But I also got checks from wealthy people, too,' he noted. 'So its not that I'm not good at it,' he said, reassuring the audience. 'I just dont think its a good way for our democracy to work.' Continuing, Obama said the campaign finance system makes Members of Congress 'miserable,' especially those that are in competitive districts, because they constantly have to raise money. It also affects legislation, he said, positing that there's a reason why lobbyists 'have undue influence' in Washington. And most of the money politicians raise goes toward television ads, he said, which leads to an over-saturated market near major elections. 'And the nature of just the blitzkrieg, you guys here in Ohio, you just feel it, right?' he said, making reference to Ohio's status as a decision-making presidential state and therefore a target for TV ads. 'I mean its just every election season, you've gotta turn off the TV. It's just depressing.' Furthermore, most of the ads are negative because science shows that's more effective than feel-good messages when it comes to political campaigns. And 'it just degrades our democracy,' Obama stated, before moving onto another aspect of the problem.",

Peter Gerard Scully, 51, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, and killing another young girl, leading to calls for the reintroduction of the death penalty. 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Tara Brown told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Peter Gerard Scully, 51, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old . Ms Brown went behind bars to face Scully in a prison in Cagayan de Oro in the country's south, where Scully is currently being held, and will be tried at the same location, facing life in prison if found guilty. Relaxed and in control throughout the interview, Scully kept referring to 'a journal' that he kept and that the reasons for his horrific actions could be explained in it only by a psychiatrist. Scully was evasive, non-committal and vague throughout the 60 Minutes interview. 'I don't want to get into any of that... Are we almost done? Because we seem to be going round in circles,' he said at one stage. Asked by Ms Brown if he had any remorse for his actions he replied: 'That's a good question. There's different degrees of remorse when you finally realise what you have done.' When pressed on why he did what he did his only answer was to 'ask the psychiatrist that question'. Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The father-of-two slipped out of Melbourne after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences and fled to Manila in 2011 where he allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused. Videos seized in the Philippines last week, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy', allegedly show a 13-year-old girl being forced to perform 'horrific' acts of whipping and torture with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, according to investigators. The 60 Minutes team was on the ground when Scully was arrested after the remains of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon and authorities, who had been keeping the 51-year-old under surveillance, swooped on his house. 'We went inside his house of horrors, right into the heart of darkness to understand exactly why it was so important that he was taken off the street,' said Ms Brown. Scully is accused of feeding a global market of paedophilic videos, charging up to $10,000 for footage of children being tortured and abused by other underage victims. 60 Minutes Tara Brown went behind bars in the Phillipines to speak to the alleged paedeophile . Scully was arrested in February on charges of sexually abusing 13 children and causing the death of another . Ms Brown claimed that several of the young girls who were groomed by Scully became partners in his video ring, falling 'into his net, manipulated to become girlfriends and later accomplices', including Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 'Part of me feels sorry for them, but I can't understand taking it to the next step into torture and possibly murder,' she said. Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, allegedly approached two cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie. She offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house. Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them. The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened,' Scully said earlier in the week . 'He is in every sense of the word a predator. His crimes are like none that the Philippine authorities had ever seen before, acts so depraved and ever escalating,' Tara Brown . Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators. It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other. 'You don't want to overuse the word monster, but that is what he is. He is the face of global perversion' said Ms Brown. 'This story is so confronting, it's a story about all lines being crossed, not just once, but repeatedly. We are talking about the sexual abuse of an 11-month-old, and the misery and lead up to the alleged death of another,' she said. Ms Brown said that Scully, a father of two grown children, claims to have remorse for his crimes. 'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened. That is something to talk about in the court which is the proper forum. There's nothing I can do to change what they [the girls] said,' Scully told The Sydney Morning Herald earlier in the week. Ms Brown said that as a mother of two young boys she is very aware of how 'innocent and trusting young people are'. 'It adds to the tragedy. It's almost beyond belief that there is something so dark within some people and when they act on that it's the most innocent that are their victims,' she said. Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme . Agent Janet Francisco (right) , who was responsible for cracking the case and the rescue of several victims from Scully's house, is pictured with one of the rescued girls (left) Peter Gerald Scully (right) was arrested for human trafficking and child porn-related offences arising from his alleged sexual abuse of Filipino girls which was filmed and then posted online for paying clients . 'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Scully said that he isn't concerned about being sentenced to life in prison. 'If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control,' he said. 'I get bigger than Ben-Hur and people get interested. There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?' Scully said. The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death. 'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.

        "input_text": "Missouri's oldest death row inmate was executed on Tuesday for murdering a sheriff's deputy, after the U.S. Supreme Court and the governor declined to spare the 74-year-old whose attorneys said he had a diminished mental capacity because of a sawmill accident decades ago. 'They brought me up here to execute me,' Cecil Clayton uttered before he was put to death by lethal injection after Governor Jay Nixon denied a clemency request. After a final meal of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, green beans and a cola, he was executed at the correctional center in Bonne Terre at 9.13pm and was pronounced dead at 9.21pm. Clayton was executed despite repeated attempts by his lawyers to spare his life, claiming he had an IQ of just 71 after suffering a traumatic brain injury decades before he killed the officer in 1996. Put to his death: Cecil Clayton, 74, was executed by lethal injection at 9:13 p.m. on Tuesday for the 1996 murder of Deputy Sheriff Christopher Castetter. He was pronounced dead at 9:21 p.m. The nation's high court turned aside appeals after the Missouri Supreme Court, in a 4-3 ruling, also declined to intervene. The court's majority concluded last weekend that there was no evidence Clayton - despite his brain injury - wasn't capable of understanding his circumstances. The U.S. Supreme Court was also divided, with four judges saying they would have granted a stay. Mike O'Connell, spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections, said in a statement that Clayton was executed at 9.13pm and pronounced dead at 9:21 p.m. The claim of diminished mental capacity stemmed from a 1972 sawmill accident that Clayton's attorneys argued cost him about eight percent of his brain, including 20 per cent of the frontal lobe portion governing impulse control and judgment. Combined with his reported IQ of 71 and reading skills of a fourth-grader, Clayton's attorneys insisted psychiatric evaluations over the past decade concluded that the inmate didn't understand the significance of his scheduled execution or the reasons for it, making him ineligible to be put to death under state and federal law. In their 11th-hour appeals, Clayton's attorneys had argued that his deteriorating mental health left him convinced his conviction was a plot against him and that God would rescue him from a death sentence at the last minute, 'after which time he will travel the country playing the piano and preaching the gospel.' The appeals were ultimately rejected. 'Cecil Clayton had - literally - a hole in his head,' said Elizabeth Unger Carlyle, one of his attorneys, following his death on Tuesday night. 'Executing him without a hearing to determine his competency violated the Constitution, Missouri law, and basic human dignity... The world will not be a safer place because Mr. Clayton has been executed.' But the victim's family were in support of his killer being put to death. Missing: A brain scan shared by his lawyers show a significant section of his brain is missing . At a press briefing on Tuesday evening, James Castetter thanked authorities for convicting Clayton for the 'senseless murder' of his brother, Chris Castetter. 'We know this execution isn't going to bring Chris back,' he said. 'But it destroys an evil person that would otherwise be walking this earth. 'There is no doubt in my mind that Cecil knew what he had done... The Great State of Missouri did not kill an innocent man. Cecil Clayton's actions is what put him to death.' Clayton was convicted of gunning down Christopher Castetter, a sheriff's deputy in rural southwest Missouri's Barry County. Castetter was 29 and a father-of-three when he went to a home near Cassville on Thanksgiving Eve 1996 to check on a suspicious vehicle report. Authorities said Clayton shot Castetter once in the forehead while the deputy was in his car, which was found against a tree, its engine racing and wheels spinning. Clayton's brother had testified that the sawmill accident led to Clayton's breakup from his wife, alcohol abuse and violent outbursts. The lethal injection, Clayton's attorneys said, was 'sure or very likely to cause excruciating or tortuous pain and needless suffering' in light of his dementia. 'If Missouri proceeds with its scheduled execution of Mr. Clayton, it will be conducting an unregulated experiment on a human subject, as there are no studies that support (the prison system's) use of Missouri's lethal injection protocol on an individual suffering from severe brain damage,' the appeals on Clayton's behalf argued. Killed: Barry County Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Castetter, pictured left, was shot dead by Clayton, pictured right in an old mug shot, as he responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in 1996 . At the weekend, when the Missouri Supreme Court issued its decision, three of the seven judges agreed that Clayton was entitled to a competency hearing. Mental health professionals who examined him agreed that he was mentally impaired and had mental health issues, including dementia. His most recent IQ test had found him to have an IQ of just 71, which is 29 points below average. 'He is not simply incompetent legally; he would be unable to care for himself or manage basic self-care, were he not in a structured environment that takes care of him,' according to a doctor who examined him, the Kansas City Star reported. 'He can shower, groom, eat, walk; it is his comprehension, judgment, memory, limited intelligence and social deficits that plague him.' In Missouri, the director of the Department of Corrections is the only one with the authority to order a competency hearing, and last year, he called on a doctor to examine Clayton. Dr. James Reynolds of the Missouri Department of Mental Health had concluded that Clayton was mentally ill, but could not be certain that he didn't understand his death sentence. But Clayton's lawyers said, while he had conversations in which he understood he was about to be executed, he would later forget that conversation ever happened. His family also called for a fair hearing on the issue. Execution: He was put to death at the state prison in Bonne Terre, pictured, on Tuesday night . Death: His family and lawyers had argued that he was child-like and did not understand the significance of his death penalty. They had called for his execution at Bonne Terre (pictured) to be stopped . 'He is brain-damaged, and talking with him is like talking to a child,' Clayton's daughter, Jena Clayton, said during his clemency petition, the Kansas City Star reported. 'I do not believe we are the kind of country that executes the disabled.' At the execution, Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read a statement from Governor Jay Nixon, in which he praised the work of Castetter. 'Our state is safer because there are brave officers, like Deputy Castetter, who are willing to sacrifice their own safety for that of others,' he said. 'As the sentence of his murderer was carried out this evening, I ask Missourians tonight to honor Deputy Castetter, who gave his life in service to our state, and to remember him and his family in their thoughts and prayers.' The execution was Missouri's second this year after the state's record 10 in 2014. It was also the first Missouri carried out in the evening after decades of having them just after midnight.",

Tornadoes were seen elsewhere in Oklahoma, as well as Arkansas. The tornado season usually ramps up for parts of the U.S. in March, but until Tuesday — when a waterspout formed over an Arkansas lake — the U.S. hadn't had a tornado in more than a month. A glass door at the Tulsa building that houses the National Weather Service office was smashed, and several cars in the parking lot lost their windows. Don Ruffin said he and a neighbor were at a convenience store in far southeast Moore when he saw the tornado approaching. 'I don't know how close it was to us, but it looked like it was coming toward us, and so we didn't take any chances,' Ruffin said. 'We got in our vehicles, ran home and got in our shelters.' Ruffin said after the storm passed, there were some fences knocked down and 'patio furniture thrown everywhere.' Incoming: A funnel cloud in part of a storm  in Sand Springs.

Harry, who served two tours of duty in the country, looked particularly solemn as Prime Minister David Cameron spoke of the 'outstanding bravery' of the men and women who fought. 'We take pride in the scale of their achievements, driving out Al Qaeda and building up the Afghan forces so they can begin to take control of their own security,' he continued .

She would pick up envelopes of cash in an alley behind the family's real estate company and told employees at the firm she would one day be their boss. Those predictions seemed like a fantasy on Wednesday as Sterling's wife went after the $3.6 million that she said the younger woman swindled from community property the couple amassed over 60 years of marriage. Scroll down for video . Court battle: 'She's been very, very nasty to me, and she's been mean to my husband': Shelly Sterling testified against V. Stiviano in the nonjury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday . Donald Sterling told a judge on Wednesday that V. Stiviano befriended a Hispanic bank employee in order to get her name illegally added to a $1 million check . 'She defrauded him and I feel that she is not entitled to any of these gifts or whatever they call them,' Shelly Sterling testified. 'She's been very, very nasty to me, and she's been mean to my husband.' Stiviano, 32, will have her own chance to testify on Thursday in the nonjury trial in Los Angeles Superior Court as to why she should keep gifts that included a duplex, Ferrari, jewelry and designer clothes. The trial put the Sterlings and Stiviano together in the same room about a year after the recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to publicly associate with blacks culminated with his lifetime ban from the NBA and the record $2 billion sale of the team. Whether Stiviano was ever a girlfriend to the billionaire or mistress, as his wife contends, she was downgraded to 'ex-friend' when Donald Sterling took the stand. Donald Sterling, 80, who has been diagnosed with symptoms of Alzheimer's, was at times forgetful and testy. He said Stiviano hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the $1.8 million duplex now in her name. Donald Sterling, 80, said Stiviano, right, hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the $1.8 million duplex now in her name . Sterling, a lawyer and shrewd businessman who made a fortune buying apartment buildings across Los Angeles, never explained why he purchased the house, though he made it clear he paid every penny because he said Stiviano was poor and her family was on welfare. He said the house was supposed to be in the name of his family trust. Noting that Stiviano is part black and Hispanic, he said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending a Hispanic bank employee who added her name to a $1 million check. Stiviano's lawyer, Mac Nehoray, said Donald Sterling gave the gifts when he was separated from his wife and that no real community property was transferred to his client. Further, he said the law does not allow a spouse to seek that money from a third party. Sterling said he only intended to loan a Ferrari and a Bentley to Stiviano, but he put them under her name so he wouldn't be liable if she killed somebody, adding that she was once charged with drunken driving. The chief financial officer of Sterling's real estate company testified that it appeared his boss was cutting checks intended for Stiviano that made it hard to trace where they went. 'I believe he was doing it to lose the bloodhounds through the creek,' Darren Schield testified. Sterling said he only intended to loan a Ferrari, pictured, and a Bentley to Stiviano, but he put them under her name so he wouldn't be liable if she killed somebody, adding that she was once charged with drunken driving . Former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling sits with V. Stiviano courtside in 2011. On Wednesday he told a judge that she had swindled items worth $3.6 million from him . Schield, who notified Shelly Sterling of the questionable checks, said he witnessed Stiviano getting envelopes of cash or cashier's checks from employees at Beverly Hills Properties and she once told the accounting department they would one day work for her. 'I thought it was pure lunacy,' he said. The Sterlings, who were at odds in the same courthouse when Shelly won the right to sell the team last year over her husband's objections, presented a mostly unified front. While Donald Sterling denied the couple was ever estranged, his wife said they separated after the death of a son. She also said she drafted divorce papers last year, but never filed them. She said their relationship remained strong and displayed several affectionate cards her husband gave her for birthdays and their anniversary. One close family friend, Betsy Superfon, said she vacations with the two and often feels like a third wheel as they walk hand-in-hand. She described meeting Stiviano in the restroom once at a Clippers game where the 'friendly girl' complimented her on her coat and purse. When she returned the favor, Stiviano gushed that Donald Sterling had bought her things and she planned to marry him. 'I said, 'But he's married to my girlfriend,' Superfon said. 'No worries, honey,' Stiviano replied. 'I'm going to be the next Mrs. Sterling.'",

        "input_text": "Men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week, according to a new study observing drinking habits in Britain. Women drank the most, between 4 and 7 drinks per week in their 40s, but lessened their drinking after 65, says research published in the Journal of BMC Medicine based on data from nine longitudinal studies in the UK. Frequent drinking (daily or most days of the week) became more common during mid to older age, most notably among men, reaching above 50 per cent of men, said the study. Men versus women: Men drink considerably more than women and at around age 25 peak at around 13 drinks per week whereas women peak in their 40s . Middle-aged men don't drink as much as men in their twenties but they tend to drink more regularly even in old age. According to the World Health Organization, Americans drink less than people living in the UK and up to 30 per cent of the US population doesn’t drink at all. The study found that non-drinking in the UK was as low as 10 per cent and that it only rose to 20 per cent in those above 90-years-old. The Washington Post reports that low to moderate drinking, especially of red wine, is linked to health benefits and it's therefore not surprising that so many men drink into old age. However, prior research has documented that both heavy drinkers and nondrinkers have higher risks of premature death than their peers who drink in moderation. Some data linked to non-drinkers may be skewed because some non-drinkers may have chosen to stop drinking due to pre-existing health problems. Drink frequency: Men drink more frequently in older age than women but don't drink as much as they did in their 20s whereas women stopped drinking at around 65-years-old . The Post also mentions that alcohol is one of the most toxic substances that people consume and can often interfere with certain blood pressure medications that people take later in life. 'It raises concerns that [men] are becoming dependent on alcohol and there are risks in this age group mixing alcohol with medications,' said Dr Annie Britton at University College London, who carried out the study. One drink doubles someone's chances of going to the emergency room and is an even greater risk for drunk drivers who may crash their car while under the influence. Heavy drinking poses grave dangers to health and makes people more likely to die from suicides, homicides, liver disease, and some cancers, reports Culture of Health.",

        "input_text": "Charles Darwin himself described them as the 'strangest animals ever discovered' and was baffled as to how they could have evolved. Now scientists have unraveled a 180 year old mystery of the evolutionary origins of South America's hooved mammals that died out 10,000 years ago. The continents native ungulates - hooved animals - have baffled palaeontologists as they share traits with rodents, elephants and camels. The four-legged Macrauchenia patachonica, shown in the artists impression above, has baffled scientists since fossils of the species, which died out around 10,000 years ago, were found by Charles Darwin 180 years ago . But now by analysing the proteins preserved in fossilised bones, scientists have been able to show that the animals are more closely related to modern horses. The technique they used also promises to reveal new information about other long-extinct fossilised species. Fossils of an ancient primate found in the Amazon may be the first monkey to have traveled from Africa across the Atlantic Ocean to South America. The discovery suggest that monkeys first arrived in South America nearly 10 million years earlier than previously thought. Scientists believe the first primates traveled to South America, which was once an isolated island before it joined to North America three million years ago, from Africa on natural rafts that drifted across the Atlantic ocean. The two groups of primates then evolved separately to create distinct families of primates. However, evidence for when this epic journey occurred has been patchy and the oldest fossil of a monkey found in the New World was 26 million years old found in Bolivia. But now fossilised teeth, found on a riverbank in a remote part of the Amazon in Peru, that have been dated at 36 million years old suggest the crossing from Africa may have occurred far earlier. A reconstruction of  the 38 million year old Perupithecus ucayalensis (left) found in South America is shown above alongside a species it closely resembled - Talahpithecus parvus, that lived in Libya 39 milion years ago . Unlike DNA, proteins can be better preserved within fossilised remains. The scientists say it could allow them to look back in time 10 times farther than current techniques using ancient DNA. Dr Ross MacPhee, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History's department of mammalogy and one of the authors of the study, said: 'Fitting South American ungulates to the mammalian family tree has always been a major challenge for palaeontologists, because anatomically they were these weird mosaics, exhibiting features found in a huge variety of quite unrelated species living all over the place . 'This is what puzzled Darwin and his collaborator Richard Owen so much in the early 19th century. 'With all of these conflicting signals, they couldn’t say whether these ungulates were related to giant rodents, or elephants, or camels—or what have you.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature, began their study by attempting to extract DNA from the fossilised bones of ungulate fossils found in South America. However, DNA breaks down quickly in the warm wet conditions found in tropical areas that cover much of South America. Instead the researchers began to look at analysing the sequence of a structural protein called collagen that is found in all animal bones. Collagen can survive more more than a million years in a range of conditions and is made up from amino acids. The sequence of these amino acids is ultimately determined by the DNA code of the animal and so can be used to draw conclusions about the species origins. The researchers screened 48 fossils of Toxodon plantensis and Macrauchenia patachonica - the same species that Darwin discovered the remains of in Uraguay and Argentina 180 years ago. Dr Ian Barnes, a molecular evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum in London who led the research, said: 'Although the bones of these animals had been studied for over 180 years, no clear picture of their origins had been reached.' The photograph above shows the skull of a Toxodon plantensis kept at the Natural History Museum in London . Charles Darwin (right) was baffled by fossils of the Toxodon (shown in the illustration on the right) when he first discovered it and scientists have struggled ever since to work out where it sits in the evolutionary tree . The modern technique, known as proteomics, allowed the researchers to show that the closest living relatives of these species were perissodactyls - the group that includes horses, rhinos and tapirs. This suggests the strange South American animals migrated into the continent from North America around 60 million years ago just after a mass extinction killed off many of the non-avian dinosaurs. The researchers now believe their technique could help to revolutionise palaeotological research by allowing scientists to reach far further back in time than they have been able to with DNA analysis. Frido Welker, the lead author of the study at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the University of York, said: 'By selecting only the very best preserved bone specimens and with various improvements in proteomic analysis, we were able to obtain roughly 90 percent of the collagen sequence for both species. 'This opens the way for various other applications in paleontology and paleoanthropology, which we are currently exploring.'",

        "input_text": "A woman suing a prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firm in a high-profile case alleging gender bias testified on Tuesday that she did not reject the initial romantic advances of a male colleague and even discussed having children with him. Plaintiff Ellen Pao told jurors the colleague, Ajit Nazre, first approached her romantically during a trip to Germany after she had been struck by a cab. She was dazed from her injuries and couldn't object to his advances, she said. In court on Tuesday: Ellen Pao(left) leaves the courthouse during a lunch break from her trial in which she claimed her former colleague Ajit Nazre (right) made sexual advances after she was in a car accident . 'I got hit by a cab and then he tried to hit on me,' Pao said. Under further questioning by Lynne Hermle, an attorney for defendant Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Pao said she and the co-worker eventually had an affair and she told him she loved him. Pao claims in her lawsuit that she was denied a promotion at the firm because of gender bias and then fired after she complained. Her lawsuit has spotlighted gender imbalance at elite Silicon Valley investment companies that are stacked with some of the nation's most accomplished graduates - multiple degree holders from schools such as Stanford and Harvard who are competing aggressively to back the next Google or Amazon. Women, however, are grossly underrepresented in the venture capital and technology sectors. Pao addressed that issue under questioning by her attorney, saying her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector. 'I've tried many times to bring Kleiner Perkins to the right path,' she told jurors. 'I think there should be equal opportunities for women and men to be venture capitalists.' Improper treatment: Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao is suing her former employer, Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, for $16 million alleging she was sexually harassed by male officials . Pao was questioned for the first time by Hermle. Their exchanges were often tense, with Pao staring at the lawyer and pausing before responding yes or no. Hermle also showed emails to the jury in which Pao and the co-worker exchanged compliments and banter. In one email from 2006, after the affair began, Pao wrote that she was always looking out for Nazre- 'never stopped, never will.' In text messages that year, she said she didn't think he was a bad person and she wasn't mad at him for not being able to have a real relationship at the time. Pao previously testified that she began the affair after the colleague said his wife had left him. She said she broke it off several months later when she learned that was a lie. Gender equality: Ellen Pao, pictured on Tuesday, said her lawsuit was aimed in part at creating equal opportunities for women in the venture capital sector . After she ended the affair, Pao testified, the colleague retaliated by shutting her out of emails and meetings. When she raised the retaliation issue with management, a senior partner explained how he had met his wife at another company while he was married, and perhaps Pao could have the same outcome with her colleague, she testified. The firm did nothing about the retaliation, she said. When it came to Pao's application to work at Kleiner Perkins, Hermle talked about the job requirements. The position called for the candidate to have a sense of humor, be intelligent, analytical, thorough, and humble, reports Business Insider. 'You understand what humble means, Ms. Pao,' Hermle asked. 'Modest, not arrogant, someone who does not exaggerate their skills,' Pao answered. 'It would also include someone who does not think they’re better than their partners?' Hermle countered. Millions in damages: Ellen Pao, pictured on March 3 and on February 26, is seeking $16 million for discrimination and retaliation in a lawsuit against the firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers . Pao also told jurors that she had sought $10 million from the firm in exchange for voluntarily leaving, saying she believed the figure would prompt the firm to change its treatment of women. Pao did not receive the money and continued working at the firm. Her lawsuit seeks $16 million in damages. Pao said she made $400,000 a year, excluding bonuses, at Kleiner Perkins, and is making $170,000 a year, with a target bonus of $80,000, as interim CEO of Reddit, her current job. Pao, 45, said Kleiner Perkins repeatedly dismissed her attempts to open a discussion about gender bias and instead hired an antagonistic investigator to look into her complaint. Kleiner Perkins has denied wrongdoing and says Pao didn't get along with her colleagues and performed poorly as a junior partner. Pao was composed on the stand under questioning by her lawyer, even while discussing potentially emotional topics such as her firing. She said Steve Hirschfeld, an investigator hired by Kleiner Perkins to look into her complaint, did not appear open to what she had to say. 'It felt antagonistic,' she said. 'There were times I felt he was grilling me about answers I didn't have.' Hirschfeld eventually concluded that Pao had not been retaliated against and there was no gender discrimination at the firm. Pao said she filed her lawsuit after running out of ways to try to get her concerns addressed within the company. But afterward, partners stopped coming to her office to talk, and she received a poor performance review that caused her to nearly vomit, she said. She was told in October 2012 to pack up her belongings and leave the office, she said.",

Dominique Pattrick, 29 and her husband Brett, 31, had been advised by staff at their three star hotel to store their valuables in a safety deposit box housed near the reception, but just four days into their trip it was raided. The padlock on the secure locker had not been tampered with but all their money, stored in two lockers, was missing. When they asked to inspect the hotel's CCTV, staff told the couple there were no cameras in the the safety deposit room as they feared it would be an 'invasion or privacy' for guests. Dominique Pattrick, 29, and her husband, Brett, 31, were left with just 10p to their name after £2,000 was stolen from their hotel's safety deposit box . The money went missing just four days into the couples sunshine break in the three star hotel in the popular  resort . Bosses at the Silver Sand Hotel in Candolim, then landed them with a bill of £13 for using the locker. Police in Goa suspect the money was stolen by a rogue member of staff at the hotel using a duplicate skeleton key. Mr and Mrs Pattrick, from Bury, Greater Manchester were forced to ring home to get their bank to activate their credit cards so they could finance the rest of the two week trip which was booked through Thomsons Holidays. Now they are only be able to reclaim £250 due to a clause in their travel insurance policy. Mrs Pattrick, an NHS therapist said: 'It was bad enough that the money went missing from the safety deposit box but to then charge us for using it was bare faced cheek. 'We were left with just a few rupees worth around ten pence and we had to ring home to unlock our credit cards to see us through. On arrival at the hotel the couple were advised to store their valuables in a locker located at the reception . 'The terrible thing was people were trying to make out that no money went missing at all. 'Goa used to be a special place and we got married there but I would never go back now.' The couple were holidaying with friends when trouble occurred on the fourth day of last month's trip. There were no CCTV camera in the secure locker room . Mrs Pattrick whose husband works as a mechanical engineer said: 'The hotel and Thomsons themselves suggested we did not keep valuables in the room and instead use the locker at reception and we assumed that was good advice. 'The money was kept in two wallets inside the locked deposit box along with a watch and four passports and the idea was to get small amounts of money every few days. It was a total shock to see the cash had gone. 'The safety deposit box was not tampered with and the lock was still intact as was left accordingly. Both wallets had even left zipped up as we left them. The only items not missing were our passports, watch and credit cards. 'We alerted the hotel and the police but we couldn't believe it when we heard there was no CCTV cameras in the area of the safety deposit boxes. The manager said there were no cameras in the safety deposit box room because he did not want guest to complain about invasion of privacy. 'It is pretty obvious what happened but they wouldn't accept responsibility for what happened to us. The manager said that the money would have been taken during the night because there were too many people around during the day and he went about calling the night receptionist and night porter to attend the police station for questioning. The police said the money was most likely stolen by a duplicate key.' A holiday rep from Thomsons logged a complaint but warned the Pattricks hotel staff doubted their allegations a rogue employee had taken the missing money. The group later moved to the nearby Marinha Dourada in Arpora. The couple had previously got married in Goa, but have said they would never return after the experience . Mrs Pattrick said her holiday was 'ruined' and she spent the whole break 'crying' as a result of the theft . Mrs Pattrick said: 'It was being implied we had stolen our own money or that the money was never in the safety deposit box to begin with. We were extremely distressed by what she was saying. 'We felt alone and unsupported from the hotel management and Thomson's reps. We just felt we could no longer stay at the hotel and the manager stated ' it was probably for the best we didn't stay at the hotel. 'Nothing was done to help us other than us requesting to move hotel to a lower star rating than we had paid for. The holiday was ruined. Lots of distress and upset was caused and we only had enough money to buy food and drink after the theft. 'Our money was stolen whilst it was in possession of the hotel and they had the timerity to charged us for it. This holiday was nothing short of a nightmare and we felt very much alone and isolated. I couldn't even tell my parents about it. All I did that holiday was cry.' A report by the Calangute police said: 'The unknown employee ie: receptionist and room boy of Silver Sand Hotel committed theft of 2000 pounds from the safe locker by using duplicate key.' A spokesman for Thomsons said: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of the group's complaint. As soon as we were made aware of their reported loss our holiday advisors in resort did everything that they could to assist, including helping them to secure a police report for their insurance claim. 'We would like to reassure customers that incidents of this type are extremely rare and also take the opportunity to remind customers of the importance of taking out a travel insurance policy when booking their holiday.'",

        "input_text": "A North Carolina man pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six to 10 years in prison on Wednesday for handcuffing an 11-year-old boy by his ankle to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as punishment. Former Emergency Room nurse Dorian Harper entered the plea to three felonies, including child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and maiming without malice. His plea came a day after a jury was seated in the case. 'Yes, sir,' Harper, 58, said when the trial judge asked if he was guilty. Dorian Harper (left) pleaded guilty on Wednesday to handcuffing his girlfriend Wanda Larson's (right) foster son, 11, to a porch with a dead chicken around his neck as a punishment . Harper rejected prosecutors' plea deal Monday, saying he wanted the trial to go on. He and his girlfriend, 58-year-old Wanda Larson, were arrested after a sheriff's deputy found the boy in November 2013. 'This is a very serious case, with very serious implications for Mr. Harper,' Judge Brad Long told the jury Tuesday. Larson was the boy's guardian and a Department of Social Services supervisor in Union County. Larson faces similar charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Authorities said they think Harper tied the dead chicken around the boy's neck as punishment for killing one of the chickens on the 5-acre farm where they lived. The indictment against the couple said the boy had been subject to abuse that also included being chained to a piece of railroad track in his room. Harper cut the boy's face with a knife and used an electric wire to burn his face, according to the indictment. The chicken: Dorian Harper is guilty of chaining his 11-year-old foster son to the porch with this chicken tied around his neck as a punishment . It also said the boy once broke his wrist trying to escape. Four other children — ages 7 to 14, all adopted by Larson — were removed from the home after Harper and Larson were arrested. They also had one 20-year-old adopted son. After his arrest,  Harper  lost his job as an emergency room nurse and Larson lost her county job working for social services. After the incident in the 2013, the 20-year-old, who didn't want to be named, said his adopted parents Wanda Larson and Dorian Harper provided a 'loving and caring home' but the boy has severe psychological issues, including a history of being cruel to animals. He said his parents' punishment, though he didn't condone it, was a last ditch attempt to control the child's behavior and protect the rest of the household. Everyone says this is some sweet innocent kid when in actuality, he is not. He has been to counseling, he is on numerous heavy medications, but nothing has worked,' the brother told KHOU in 2013. The brother said he believes the chicken around the neck was supposed to 'shame the child.' 'There has to be something going on, between that child and that chicken,' he said. 'He either, one, didn't feed it and it died, or two, either he was out there harassing the chicken. He may have killed the chicken. This child has been known to be cruel to animals.' He said the controversial discipline was his father's doing, as his mother, who would have put a stop to it, wasn't home at the time. The brother explained the 11-year-old, who had lived at the home since he was six, was a problem child who was underweight because of a health problem, not because he was being mistreated. 'He would sneak out into the garage take raw meat out of the freezer, let it thaw overnight and next day go out there and eat it raw,' the man, who moved out of the home two years ago, when he turned 18, told KHOU. The home: Police and neighbors described the family's home as being covered in feces with such a pungent smell it 'takes your breath away' 'He has severe psychological issues.' 'He was not allowed to carry his own lunch box because would eat what food is in his lunch and then, throw the lunch box away and say he didn't have lunch for the day.' Union County Sheriff deputies plan to interview the other four children to get a clearer view of their living environment. But the brother insisted his parents cared for the children. 'Everyone assumed all five children in the home have been abused, that is not accurate. You ask all four of the children, they will say they lived in a loving and caring home,' he said. The account contradicts claims from the 11-year-old's relatives who say they have tried for years to get DSS to look into the allegations of abuse. Union County Sheriff Animal Services were at the house early this week gathering the property's remaining animals, including an estimated 75 fowl (chicken, ducks, guineas and peacock) three horses, three donkeys, two llamas, eight dogs and a hog. It was revealed the boy was routinely handcuffed to a piece of steel inside the farm house in Union Country by his foster parents, who were preventing him from running away. Police in North Carolina have released more information on the shocking case - including how the smell of the feces-covered house would 'take your breath away' - as neighbors come forward describing how the boy would beg them for food and, at one point, was 'purple with cold' and 'looked pitiful'. Disturbing: Larson, a former child services worker, lived at this property with four adopted children and the 11-year-old who was the only foster child . Another neighbor, who asked not to be named, said a boy appeared on her porch in May 2012 'purple with cold, with no coat, saying he was hungry'. 'When asked, he said he had no mother or father and didn't know where he lived,' she said. The woman brought him inside and fed him a sandwich. 'It didn’t take him 10 seconds to eat it,' she said. He told her he was 10-years-old and that he had slept in her barn, behind her house, the night before. When she told him she would take him home, she said, he answered: 'No. I want to stay here.' Her daughter called 911 and a sheriff's deputy came out, spoke with the boy, made a phone call, then told him she'd take him home. 'He didn't refuse. He just went with her.' The neighbor said the deputy let her know she had returned him to his foster parents and said the man insisted the boy hadn't been missing more than 30 minutes. The neighbor believes it was the Harper-Larson home. 'I know that’s where she took him (although) you can’t see the house from the road.' Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said said the condition of the house was 'terrible'. 'It was filthy, feces on the floor, holes in the wall,' he said. Chance finding: Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to this porch . 'The bathroom, you could see from outside of the hall into the bathroom. Sink was trashed. No running water. The smell took your breath away.' All the children appeared to be suffering from malnutrition and Cathey said that the first thing law enforcement did for them was buy them pizza. Authorities stumbled across the disturbing situation after a deputy, who was responding to an animal services complaint at a neighboring property, saw the 11-year-old handcuffed to the porch. He approached the house and was confronted by Harper. The deputy asked for Harper's identification and an explanation as to why the child was handcuffed to the porch. According to WBTV, one of the children opened the front door, releasing several large dogs who attacked the deputy. By the time he had the dogs under control, Harper had removed the child from the porch and left the dead chicken on a barrel in front of the house. Other officers arrived and following a search of the house, a criminal investigation was opened. 'It's just shocking,' Captain Ronnie Whitaker said on Saturday. 'It's just disturbing that anyone would treat a child in such a manner.'",

Anticipating a wall of water that could equal the height of a four-storey building, tourists and locals staked out positions around the picturesque landmark last night and again today, including the partially-washed out causeway as the tide retreated. They travelled to France’s northern coast for the first giant tide of the millennium, with experts predicting that it could reach as high as 46ft - 18ft above normal - thanks to the effects from yesterday’s spectacular solar eclipse. Scroll down for video . Tens of thousands of people are visiting the Atlantic coastline in France, including Mont Saint-Michel, for the 'supertide' Tidal specialist Nicolas Pouvreau told French media that the surge was a few inches short of expectations . French officials said the supertide would be a major opportunity for tourism in Brittany, including the walled port city of Saint-Malo . Large waves crash over the crowded waterfront - leaving spectators soaking wet - during the incoming tide in Saint-Malo, France . But tidal specialist Nicolas Pouvreau told France 24 the surge was a few inches short of expectations. Mont Saint-Michel was briefly turned into an island at high tide, but low tide provided an opportunity for people to walk on the expansive flat seabed. Although it is dubbed the ‘tide of the century’, the ‘supertide’ phenomenon occurs once every 18 years when a rare alignment of the sun, moon and Earth create a massive gravitational pull on the sea. On each occasion, Mont Saint-Michel provides a stunning setting for those looking to watch the phenomenon.

Experts said the last 'tide of the century' occurred on March 10, 1997 and people will have to wait until March 2033 for the next one . This morning's high tide was close to peak levels as the sea rushed in from over eight miles out, but calm weather diminished the risk of flooding and let down some of the visitors who travelled from afar. Tourist Jean-Bernard Delamarche, who visited Saint-Malo, said: 'For the \"tide of the century\" I am a bit disappointed. We came one year, we were staying at the hotel Ibis and we could not get out of the hotel because the street was flooded. But it's true that it is impressive.' US student Noah Feingold added: 'It's almost more spectacular at low tide in the end because you will be able to walk kilometres and see some little secret beaches that will only be revealed at this moment.' High tides triggered by the eclipse saw water flooding over the banks of the River Thames today as alerts remained in place for parts of the UK. The Thames Barrier has closed for the 175th time today in its 30 year lifespan, the first operational closure of 2015 and the first of the 2014 to 2015 winter season. As the moment of high tide approached, the river flooded on to the path in Barrier Gardens. Flood alerts were also issued for parts of Teddington and Twickenham. High tides were reported in Greenwich, Putney Embankment, Chiswick Mall and Strand-on-the Green in Chiswick.

The Gaver family had allegedly been camping out in the parking lot for a few days when they had a confrontation with police which resulted in the death of Enoch Gaver. Ten-year Cottonwood Police veteran Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31, and suspect David Gaver were also shot in the attack and hospitalized. Meanwhile, the remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: The suspects who engaged in a shootout with police in a Cottonwood, Arizona Walmart parking lot on Saturday have been identified as eight members of a Idaho family band. Above, two of the suspects, currently jailed: Jeremiah Gaver, 28 (left), and Nathaniel Gaver, 27 (right) Fighting cops: Police say the shootout was sparked by one of the Gavers pushing a Walmart store employee while trying to use the building's restroom. Above, suspects Ruth and Peter Gaver, 52 and 55 . Fatal: One member of the Gaver family was killed in the shootout, now identified as Enoch Gaver. When police arrived on the scene, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to the Arizona DPS . On duty: Cottonwood Police Sgt Jeremy Daniels, 31 (pictured), was shot in the leg during the attack but is expected to make a full recovery. One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen and remains hospitalized . The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked Saturday when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days. DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. The shots killed Enoch Gaver and injured relative David Gaver and Sgt Jeremy Daniels. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle. Musical team: The Gavers were allegedly part of a band called Matthew 24 Now, which sometimes played outside a grocery store in Boise, Idaho. Above, a picture of the band from their Facebook page. Matthew 24 is a Bible verse dealing with the end of times . As of Tuesday, David Gaver was still hospitalized but once he is released he will be taken to jail to join four of his adult relatives. Jeremiah Gaver, 28, is currently jailed under suspicion of aggravated assault, Peter Gaver, 55, for hindering prosecution and resisting arrest, Nathaniel Gaver, 27, for assault on a law-enforcement officer and Ruth Gaver, 52 for the same charge. A boy and girl from the Gaver family are currently being held at the Prescott Juvenile Detention facility. Their identities have not been released. Dwight D'Evelyn of the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office says the Gavers are being held on bonds ranging from $25,000 to $75,000. Injuries: A Walmart store employee and other police officers were also injured in the incident, including lacerations and some broken bones . The Gavers are due in court for their first hearing on March 31. Graves says the family have not been cooperating with the DPS investigation. According to Facebook, the family is part of a band called 'Matthew 24 Now' (they are also go by 'Busking in the Son' back in Idaho). The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. In a message on the Facebook page, the family writes: 'We won't do any events where there's gonna be illegal drugs. Or any form of promiscuity.' A local Idaho station reported that the family sometimes played music outside an Albertson's grocery store in Boise.",

        "input_text": "The case of the 'Gone Girl' physiotherapist and her boyfriend who were accused of staging her kidnapping has taken another strange twist – a group who are claiming to be the kidnappers have demanded an apology from the police. Densie Huskins, 29, was allegedly snatched from her home by kidnappers who tied her boyfriend up on March 23, then released one day later 400 miles away beside her parents' home. After her ‘release’ police accused them of staging the kidnapping – a claim they both strongly denied. Now the San Francisco Chronicle has received a string of anonymous emails from the apparent kidnappers in which they compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11 and claim they will strike again. Scroll down for video . The self-proclaimed kidnappers behind the Gone Girl abduction of Denise Huskins (second from right with her mother and two brothers) are demanding police apologize for calling the incident a hoax . In an email to the San Francisco Chronicle, the group threatens the Vallejo Police Department anbd spokesman Lt. Kenny Park (above) that they will 'cause harm' if Huskins faces criminal charges . They also say they monitored Huskins' boyfriend Aaron Quinn (above) after the kidnapping so he would not go to police, which is why he did not call authorities for 12 hours . In an email the kidnappers write; 'I/we may be the direct agent of harm. But it will be made crystal clear that the Vallejo Police Department, and you, Mr. [Kenny] Park, had every opportunity to stop it.' Last week Lt. Park, the spokesman for the Vallejo Police Department, said that the kidnapping of Huskins, which triggered a statewide search that involved 100 volunteers, 40 detectives and numerous FBI agents, was  an 'orchestrated event.' The letter to the Chronicle says authorities have until noon on Tuesday to apologize. It also demands that the police make clear that neither Huskins or her boyfriend Aaron Quinn - who was with her at the time she was allegedly kidnapped but waited 12 hours to call police - will face any criminal charges. As for the main reason behind the kidnapping, they write; 'The Mare Island kidnapping was a training mission to test means and methods that would be used on higher net worth targets.' They then compare themselves to the cast of Ocean's 11, the famous caper film that starred members of the Rat Pack when it premiered in 1960 and Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and George Clooney in the 2001 remake. It is not the first email the alleged kidnappers have sent the paper either, also reaching out to them on March 24 with an audio file of Huskins to prove she was still alive one day after being taken from her home in Mare Island. She  eventually turned up in Huntington Beach, where both of her parents live, just a few hours later. This latest email, sent on Saturday from a dummy account, was 9,000 words long, and detailed why the group kidnapped Huskins, and how they went about taking her from her home. The group consists of three members, two with college educations, and they claim they are also behind a recent string of burglaries and car thefts in the area. They claim they drilled holes in the window of Huskins and Quinn's home to gain entry, and then used squirt guns with 'strobe flashlights and laser pointers' attached to them to make it appear as if they were firearms. They say they played 'calming music' as they went about the abduction, and put monitors on Quinn, 30, so they could make sure he did not go to police. They then say they put Huskins in the trunk of Quinn's car and drove off with her. The group of three people claim they drilled a hole in a window of Huskins and Quinn's home (above) and used squirt guns that they made to look like guns to take Huskins . The kidnapping, which has been called an 'orchestrated event' by authorities, has drawn comparisons to the film Gone Girl (above) In the end however, they claim it was a case of mistaken identity, and they did not mean to take Huskins, thinking that someone else would be in the house. They say that is why they decided to drop her off in Huntington Beach and that they were 'horrified at what we had done.' As for the ransom they requested, what police believe to be a rather paltry $8,500, the group said; 'We chose $8,500 because it was below the $10,000 reporting threshold, and far enough below that it likely would not be flagged as part of a structured transaction under that prong of the reporting law.' Attorneys for both Quinn and Huskins claim that their clients have confirmed aspects of this email, and that they have sent photos of the holes drilled in the window that the kidnappers used to gain access to prove that whoever sent this note is telling the truth. Huskins' attorney, Doug Rappaport, said that the reason police called the incident a hoax is because the kidnappers used 'sophisticated computer skills' that neither they or the FBI could 'comprehend.' Lt. Park, the Vallejo Police Department and the FBI all have yet to comment on the emails.",

The video shows the man in the red T-shirt approach Autry who was sitting at the front of the train. According to Autry, the attacker first asked to use his cell phone. When he refused, the man asked for his opinion on the death of Michael Brown. 'I responded I was too tired to think about it right now,' Autry told KMOV. 'The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face.' The video shows the suspect unleash a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who tries to block them with his hand and forearms. Two other men, described by police as in their 20s, then join in. As the train pulled into a station, the man in the red T-shirt kicks his victim in the head before escaping. The train's surveillance cameras clearly captured  their faces and police have said that they face possible charges of third-degree assault. David Autry said he was most upset that no one stepped in to help him and worse he could hear people laugh . The victim was left with bruises on his face and forehead, but declined medical treatment. Autry told KMOV he was more upset that no one stepped in to help and worse he could hear people laugh. 'I think it was disgusting that people were sort of laughing and smiling about it,' he said. 'And no one offered to help. No one seemed to call 911.' Autry has said he would prefer not to use public transportation in future and he has set up a GoFundMe page in the hope of raising $5,000 to buy a motorcycle. The page was setup on Saturday and he has already raised over $1,500. Autry also plans to donate some of the proceeds to neighborhood victims of violent crimes. Unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson in nearby Ferguson last August following an altercation.

        "input_text": "A documentary maker who embarked on a high-sugar diet for 60 days to demonstrate the dramatic effect of sugar on the body has weighed into the debate about controversial new coke product, 'Coke Life'. Health experts have accused Coca Cola of ‘health washing’ consumers with the launch of its new ‘lower-calorie’ soft drink as it still contains the full amount of an adult’s recommended daily allowance of sugar. Damon Gameau spent two months eating so-called 'healthy' foods such as juice, cereal and sports drinks for a documentary called That Sugar Film - exposing the prevalence of 'hidden sugars'. Australian actor Damon Gameau reintroduced sugar into his diet after three years with shocking results . Coca-Cola Life (left) comes in a green can and although it has less sugar than regular Coca-Cola (right) it still contains six teaspoons of sugar . Dr Rooney highlighted research carried out in the eighties where rats were given a sugar solution, a saccharin [artificial sweetener] solution and only drank a certain amount. But when the rats were given both sugar and saccharin mixed together they drank more than they normally would. ‘It’s called a super mix, a little bit of sugar and sweetener drives over consumption… if this translates to the human population then that is fantastic for Coke’s profit line,’ Dr Rooney said. Coke Life has its very own ‘super mix’ of both sugar and Stevia - a type of sweetener. ‘Coke will be pushing more products but we will be doing more detriment to our health,’ Dr Rooney warned. When it comes to the green colour of the Coke Life packet it can give off a ‘healthy vibe’, Dr Rooney said. He noted Coke would have done a great amount of market research before they launched the product. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley launched Coca-Cola Life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - back in London in September . In documentary 'That Sugar Film' he aims to highlight the sugars that are often hidden in 'health' foods . ‘There would have been some work that went into the association of green with health. I can understand how on some superficial level at least that it is seen as a healthier product. ‘But people should be aware that a sugar sweetened beverage is still an excessive calorie product with no nutritional benefits,’ he said. Dr Rooney explained that ‘liquid calories’ are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food. ‘If you are looking to improve health the very first step is to remove your liquid calories,’ Dr Rooney said. The best drinks to consume are water and milk, he advised. And when it comes to Coke’s claims that they are trying to help battle the obesity epidemic, Dr Rooney said it is ‘disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate for Coke to frame their products as healthy.’ Dr Rooney said it is 'disingenuous, duplicitous and highly inappropriate' for Coke products to be marketed as healthy . Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years . Sugary drinks do not just cause weight gain they rot teeth, increase fat on the liver and fat around the waist, he explained . ‘I think it is deceitful and they are sitting there saying the only health worry is weight, which is absolutely wrong.’ Dr Rooney explained that 'liquid calories' are the worst type of calorie source because the body metabolises them differently to solid food . Professor Amanda Lee of Queensland University of Technology, and former chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council's Dietary Guidelines Working Committee, told the Sydney Morning Herald the launch of Coca Cola Life is an example of ‘greenwashing’. ‘It reminds me of the stage we were up at 30 years ago when manufacturers were making healthy cigarettes. I'm worried, it's trying to make a product that's intrinsically unhealthy, healthy,’ she said. ‘There's a high risk that many consumers could be confused, thinking that it's a low-energy option when it's not.’ The product, which hit Australian shelves on Monday, has more natural ingredients than Diet Coke because it doesn’t use artificial sweeteners like Aspartame. Lisa Winn, Coca-Cola South Pacific Marketing Director, said: ‘Coca-Cola Life truly is another example of us keeping in step with consumer demands. ‘We’re confident that the new product is what consumers have been looking for. We’ve achieved the taste you’d expect from Coca-Cola with 35% reduced sugar and kilojoules, compared to Coca-Cola.’ ‘Coke Life isn’t simply a new product from Coca-Cola – it’s another great choice for people who want a delicious Coca-Cola to fit their lifestyle. There is a Coca-Cola option for everyone,’ she said. It is only the fourth drink to be launched in the Trademark’s 128-year history. Peach flavour Lipton Ice Tea has over eight teaspoons of sugar, while Vitamin Water has seven . V Energy Drinks which promise to give you 'energy' have 13 teaspoons of sugar in them . The new addition to Coke's range of 3,500 beverages, should also not be mistaken for Coke Zero, which is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men who don't like the word 'diet' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic Coca-Cola. Coke Life is roughly inbetween Diet Coke and classic Coca-Cola when it comes to calories – you will still find 27 in a can. However, it has 35 per cent less sugar than classic Coke because it uses the natural plant Stevia and sugar as sweeteners, rather than just sugar. Aspartame is a man-made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages. The safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies. However, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure. People with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it. Coke Zero (left) is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate 'diet' drinks with women. Unlike Diet Coke (right), which is completely sugar free, Coke Life still has sugar . Nutritionist Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said that Stevia is not known to have any health risks but that doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink Coke Life. 'Nutrition Australia would still say that while it's safe it's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets. Stevia is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained. You can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream, water-based beverages, brewed soft drinks, plain and flavoured soy beverages. It can be used in cooking and baking according to the Stevia Australia website, excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar. It has been used in Japan as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both FSANZ and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the EFSA and USFDA. FSANZ has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns. 'The problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion. 'The other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks, whether sweetened naturally or artificially, are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it. No matter what, the best drink is water and that’s we’d still agree.' If you’re wondering what the need for another low-calorie Coke drink is, the global brand which is worth an estimated $74 billion US dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives. Aspartame is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well-known brands of food, drink and medicine. However, it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health. One study linked diet drinks containing Aspartame to premature births, while another suggested it could cause cancer. However, in December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe, so Coca-Cola has continued to use it. Powerade has over eight teaspoons of sugar and Gatorade has nine teaspoons . Coca-Cola Life does not contain Aspartame so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than Diet Coke. 'I guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful. But because research hasn’t been done checking Stevia it seems to be quiet safe in those respects,’ Ms Hourigan said. Coke Life is meant to taste similar to classic Coca-Cola but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage. Rival soft drink brand Pepsi have also brought out a drink that uses Stevia as a sweetener in some markets. They have named it Pepsi Next.",

        "input_text": "Former University of Oklahoma fraternity member Levi Pettit publicly apologized this afternoon for leading a racist chant aboard a bus in a leaked video that shocked the nation. Pettit, who grew up in a wealthy  suburb of Dallas, Texas, started his contrition tour with one of his most vocal critics - state Senator Anastasia Pittman. Pittman accepted his apology, but said it's not enough - that he needs to offer contrition to black church leaders and students, as well. 'Some have wondered why I hadn't spoken out publicly. The truth is I have had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions,' said Pettit, whose voice quivered slightly as he spoke. 'I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until I first came to apologize to those most directly impacted.' Scroll down for video . Mea culpa: Levi Pettit, one of the University of Oklahoma frat boys who led a racist chant on a bus last month, publicly apologized for his actions Wednesday after meeting with a group of black leaders . What he said: The 20-year-old, who has been expelled from OU, said he was 'upset and embarrassed' that he failed to stop the chant. He also claimed he did not know the words he was using were 'wrong' Addressing Senator Pittman directly, the 20-year-old expelled OU student said: 'You're a blessing to me, my mom, and my dad. I can't than you enough for the way you've embraced me and opened my eyes to things I had not seen before.' Pettit then formally apologized for his behavior, which was captured on camera last month, resulting in the disbandment of OU's chapter of the Sigma Epsilon Alpha fraternity. 'Let me start by saying that I am sorry, deeply sorry. I’m so sorry for all the pain that I’ve caused an I want you all to know that directly from me,' Pettit, dressed in a dark suit and red tie, said from a podium, surrounded by black leaders. 'Although I don’t deserve it, I want to ask for your forgiveness. There are no excuses for my behavior.' The young Texan said he never considered himself to be a racist and added that he was 'upset and embarrassed' that he failed to stop the infamous chant on the bus filled with his fraternity brothers. Apology accepted: Senator Pittman (left) said she believes Pettit's apology is genuine and she has forgiven him . Mending fences: Pittman said she admires Pettit for having the courage to reach out to her . 'All the apologies in the world won’t change what I’ve done,' Pettit said off a podium at an Oklahoma City Baptist church. When asked by a reporter whether he was aware in the moment that the words he was chanting were racial slurs, Pettit pleaded ignorance. 'I knew they were wrong, but I never knew how or why they were wrong,' he insisted. 'The people I've met with...have really opened my eyes to the impact of those words. 'The truth is what was said in that chant is disgusting ... and after meeting with these people I've learned these words should never be repeated,' he stated. Pettit answered only a few questions from reporters but declined to say who taught him the chant or where he learned it. Levi Pettit has gone on an apology tour after he was caught singing 'there will never be a n**** SAE' earlier this month . Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, said she believes Pettit's apology is genuine and she has forgiven him. 'I admire his courage of reaching out to me and saying: \"I want to meet with you face to face and apologize to you directly,\"' Pittman said. 'I believe he is sincere.' Going forward, student groups at OU are considering inviting Pettit to participate in panel discussions on race relations at the university – but the events would have to take place off-campus or online because he has been barred from stepping foot on OU grounds after having been expelled. It comes as the high-power attorney hired by the now-disbanded Oklahoma chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon says no other members of the fraternity will be expelled over the incident. Thank you all for being here today. Even though I wish with all my heart today’s meeting was not necessary, I am deeply appreciative to the leaders that joined us. Thank you Senator Pittman for inviting me here today - for you are a blessing to me and my mom and dad. I can never thank you enough for the way you have embraced me and opened my eyes to things I had not seen before. Let me start by saying that I am sorry … deeply sorry. I am so sorry for the pain I have caused, and I want all of you to know that directly from me. Although not deserved, I ask for your forgiveness. There are no excuses for my behavior. I never thought of myself as a racist. I never even considered the possibility. But the bottom line is that the words I said in the chant were mean, and hateful… and racist. I will be deeply sorry and deeply ashamed of what I have done for the rest of my life. Some have wondered why I hadn’t spoken out publicly. The truth is I have had a mix of pain, shame, sorrow and fear over the consequences of my actions. I did not want to apologize to the press or to the whole country until I first came to apologize to those most directly impacted. So I decided it would be best to wait until the student and community leaders I met with today were back from Spring Break. I think the best way to express the truth about who I am and what I feel is to read to you a letter that I sent to President Boren a few days after the bus ride. The words in that letter are all heart-felt words, and I thank President Boren for accepting my apology. Yesterday, I was humbled by the fact that I had a chance to meet face to face with members of the football leadership team. They accepted my apology and together discussed steps we can take to make sure this never happens again. Over the past week or so, I have met with a number of pastors and leaders in the community to seek understanding of the meaning behind the words I spoke on the bus. Meeting with a few people does not change what I did, but it has begun to change me, and my understanding of those hateful words. Without question, my words on that bus were disgusting and these words should never be repeated under any circumstance. I am also upset and embarrassed that I failed to stand up as a leader and stop this chant. I now have a clearer understanding of what lives behind the words. From this point forward, I will be the leader I should have been on the bus and stand up against racism in any form. Now, before I take a couple of your questions, . Let me just say this: . All the apologies in the world won’t change what I have done. So I will spend the rest of my life trying to be a person who heals and brings people of all races together. That is what I hope and pray will come out of this. Oklahoma state Senator Anastasia Pittman, one of the most vocal critics of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, has arranged for Pettit to meet with black community leaders, including students, for him to apologize . Stephen Jones, who defended Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh says he reached a deal in his legal proceedings with the university. The other details of the agreement are not clear. Before Pettit's brief press conference this afternoon, he met behind closed doors with top black politicians, pastors and students. 'I wanted him to be educated on some of the struggles they've endured,' Pittman said. 'I think that will enlighten him and give him a new perspective on a culture that he is completely unaware of.' Pettit's parents outed him as one of the instigators of the song 'there will never be a n***** SAE,' which he was recorded singing gleefully on a bus full of members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Pettit is one of two students expelled from Oklahoma over the video. The SAE fraternity was also kicked off campus and the brothers were evicted from their house by the university. Parker Rice is the other student identified on camera. Among those scheduled to attend the private meeting on Wednesday is Marilyn Luper-Hildreth, the daughter of the late civil rights leader Clara Luper, an Oklahoma City schoolteacher who led sit-ins at segregated Oklahoma City drugstore counters in the late 1950s. Pettit's parents, who live in the Dallas area, issued an apology on his behalf two weeks ago after the video's release caused an uproar on the university's campus in Norman, which is located about 20 miles south of Oklahoma City. A second student from the Dallas area, Parker Rice, also issued a statement apologizing for his role in the chant. OU President David Boren severed ties with the fraternity, ordered its members to vacate the fraternity house and expelled two students for leading the chant. The university also launched an investigation into the role other fraternity members may have had in the chant, and Boren says further disciplinary action is possible. The national Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity also disbanded its OU chapter and announced it is taking steps to become more inclusive, including requiring all of its members nationwide to go through diversity training and setting up a confidential hotline for people to report inappropriate behavior. Boren also planned to meet later Wednesday with student leaders of the university's fraternity and sorority system to discuss race relations and the reaction of students to the incident.",

Running back Bernard Pierce was pulled over in Towson, Maryland, in the early  morning hours of Wednesday and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. This after his teammates Terrence Cody and Victor Hampton were also arrested earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Baltimore Ravens running back Bernard Pierce (above) was pulled over in Towson, Maryland, early Wednesday and charged with driving under the influence . Pierce, a member of the Ravens when they won the 2012 Super Bowl, failed a field sobriety test and was taken in and released from the station after being cooperative with officers . Baltimore County police told The Baltimore Sun that Pierce, 23, was pulled over for speeding around 2am, and after an officer suspected he had been drinking the footballer was ordered to perform a field sobriety test. After failing the test, a cooperative Pierce was taken to the station, processed and later released. According to TMZ, he told police; 'Do you know what happened the last time a Ravens player got a DUI? I'm getting cut tomorrow, not like you care.' Pierce, a member of the team when they won the Super Bowl in 2012, has been charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, driving while impaired by alcohol, exceeding maximum speed, and driving a vehicle in excess of reasonable and prudent speed on highway. 'We are aware of the situation and learning more about it. We take these matters seriously,' said Ravens spokesperson Chad Steele. This  just weeks after Hampton, 22, was also arrested and charged with driving under the influence after he was recorded driving 100 mph in a 55-mph zone in North Carolina. He was booked after recording a 0.10 blood-alcohol level, and later released when he posted a $2,500 bond. This also comes just weeks after Pierce's Ravens teammate Victor Hampton (above) was also arrested for a DUI, and cut from the team the next day . Tackle Terrence Cody (above) was also arrested this year and indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury . The Ravens released the cornerback the next day. As for Cody, he was indicted on 15 counts of animal cruelty and drug charges by a grand jury in February following an incident in which his pet alligator allegedly ate his dog. He was also found to have  marijuana and drug paraphernalia in his home. The tackle was also dropped from the team prior to his indictement. Cody claims that his dog died of worms, and not because he was attacked by the alligator, which was illegally owned. All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay (above) in a hotel elevator . All this comes after the Ravens had one of their worst year's ever off the field, with star player Ray Rice being caught on video physically abusing his now-wife Janay in a hotel elevator and team coming under fire for their handling of the situation and questioned over how much they knew about the incident before details were leaked to the public. He was soon cut from the team, but appealed the decision and ultimately won the right to be reinstated in the NFL. He then sued the team for the $3.5million he lost in salary, with the two sides settling out of court before a trial could begin.",

This image shows the skeleton of the ‘Nariokotome Boy’ (Homo ergaster) Three species are generally recognised to have roamed Africa during this time frame: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo ergaster . Researcher Dr Jay Stock, from Cambridge University's Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, said: 'If someone asked you 'are modern humans six foot tall and 70kg?' you'd say 'well, some are, but many people aren't, and what we're starting to show is that this diversification happened really early in human evolution.' Nutrition and local environmental factors probably played a role in making some early humans larger than others. Experts also believe that sexual dimorphism (pronounced differences in appearance between males and females, such as size) might have played a part too. ‘However, almost all studied… groups include smaller and larger individuals and assessing sex based on the isolated and fragmentary postcranial remains of early Homo is nearly impossible,’ they say in the study. Another possibility, thought to be less likely, is that there were numerous species belonging to the human family Homo that varied in appearance. Measurements of fossils from sites in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Georgia in eastern Europe, revealed significant regional variation in the size of early humans during the last Ice Age. Some groups, such as those living Olduvai, Tanzania, measured just 4.8 feet on average, while those from the Koobi Fora region of Kenya grew to heights of 5.8 feet. The evidence also suggests that big bodies and long legs were not prerequisites for spreading out of Africa into Europe and Asia. The main increase in body size occurred tens of thousands of years after the small, primitive human Homo erectus migrated out of Africa. Fossils show that Homo erectus, which averaged less than five foot in height and weighed less than eight stone, was living in Georgia 1.77 million years ago. Some groups, such as those living Olduvai, Tanzania, measured just 4.8 feet on average, while those from the Koobi Fora region of Kenya grew to heights of almost six foot. A table showing the variation is pictured . Measurements of fossils from sites in Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Georgia in eastern Europe, revealed significant regional variation in the size of early humans during the last Ice Age. This the landscape of the West Turkana region of Kenya is where the skeleton of Homo ergaster was found . 'The evolution of larger bodies and longer legs can no longer be assumed to be the main driving factor behind the earliest excursions of our genus to Eurasia,' said co-author Manuel Will, from Tubingen University in Germany. The scientists, whose findings are reported in the Journal of Human Evolution, developed a method of calculating the height and body mass of individuals from small fossil fragments, some no bigger than toes. Dr Stock said: 'In human evolution we see body size as one of the most important characteristics, and from examining these 'scrappier' fossils we can get a much better sense of when and where human body size diversity arose. 'Before 1.7 million years ago our ancestors were seldom over five foot tall or particularly heavy in body mass. 'When this significant size shift to much heavier, taller individuals happened, it occurred primarily in one particular place - in a region called Koobi Fora in northern Kenya around 1.7 million years ago. 'That means we can now start thinking about what regional conditions drove the emergence of this diversity, rather than seeing body size as a fixed and fundamental characteristic of a species.' ‘The results demonstrate chronological and spatial variation, but no simple temporal or . geographical trends for the evolution of body size among early Homo….suggesting that migrations into Eurasia were not contingent on larger body sizes,’ the study says . Body size has been implicated as a factor contributing to both brain evolution and the first hominin dispersals into Eurasia . One argument suggests that as lower limbs lengthened and hominins assumed limb proportions more similar to modern humans, they became more mobile and changed their foraging behaviour and diet. But fossil fragments have now shown a richer variety of sizes and this may not be the case. The ecomorphological model says that Homo ergaster was the first hominin to colonize other continents due to its energetically efficient bipedal locomotion, long distance travel abilities, large home range sizes and habitat tolerance. But fossil evidence for body size now suggests the marked increase of body size variables in early Homo took place after 1.8 Million years in eastern Africa. By this point, the dispersals already happened, suggesting that migrations into Eurasia were possible without a significant increase in body size and possibly lower limb length. Interestingly, the study says that there was an increase in body size at the start and end of the period studied, which suggests that factors other than chronology also influenced the body size of early humans.",

        "input_text": "An Australian couple spent five terrifying hours trapped inside the car with their two young children not knowing whether they were going to survive the wrath of Cyclone Pam which tore apart the island of Vanuatu. Beth and Kris Russet moved to the island in 2009 and spent 18 months building a cyclone-proof house before moving into the beautiful home just four months ago in November with their children Charlotte, 3, and Henry,14 months, and also Beth's mother. But nothing could have prepared the couple for the hell they endured as each room in their brand new home began to rapidly fill up with water after the ceiling was ripped off leaving the petrified family exposed to the ferocious and deadly elements of the worst cyclone to have hit the Pacific region in living memory. Beth Russet - left with Henry, and Kris Russet - right with Charlotte, 3, spent five terrifying hours in their car as Cyclone Pam hit Vanuatu . The polished new deck before it got ripped apart - pictured are the two German Shepherds who survived the cyclone on back of the ute . The entire roof of the decking blew off during the cyclone and exposed plywood was flying through the house . The brand new open kitchen and dining room where the family used to spend a lot of their time . The ceiling in the kitchen was ripped off and rain started coming in sideways along with a ferocious wind tunnel . The night began like any other for the Russet's on March 13, they had settled in to watch a movie with a glass of wine in hand after putting the kids to bed. However, within two hours the pair were frantically moving their children and Beth's mother from one room to another as their family home began to resemble an indoor swimming pool. 'Our walls started to rain - it was coming in too hard and too fast,' Beth said. 'I had to put Henry in the pram because I couldn't carry him while we kept having to move them from one room to the next.' 'We were trying to stay calm for the kids but the roar of the wind was so amazing that we had to keep yelling at each other over the noise. 'We were tying to keep our happy faces on so the kids would be fine.' But this was no easy feast as the entire roof from the large decking outside had torn off causing exposed plywood to come flying into the open living area. 'All of the doors stayed shut but as soon as the roof came off it was as if we had no walls - then the kitchen fan flew off and rain started coming in sideways and a wind tunnel began,' she said. 'We couldn't get from one side of the house to the other without help and holding hands because it was flood waters and the wind was just so strong.' Three-year -old Charlotte's room is completely trashed after the epic storm . The ceiling was blasted open with parts falling onto the ground in 14 month old Henry's nursery . Probably the scariest of many hairy moments throughout the night was when Beth's mum and Kris had a ceiling collapse from above them in the master bedroom just as Beth had moved the children into her son's nursery. 'I turned around to get my mum from the bedroom when the ceiling came in on her and the ceiling fan missed her head by inches,' Beth said. 'The door slammed with the wind and I couldn't get in - I had no idea how she was but luckily my husband was in there and she was ok.' The family vowed to stick together from that point on - including their two German Shepherds and a reluctant cat. Eventually they moved to the bathroom because there was too much potential for the nursery ceiling to collapse as water was pouring in from the down lights, however the bathroom presented the exact same problem. 'We did the big dramatic run to the kids bathroom because it's mainly concrete walls and a big bath tub so we thought it would be really safe there,' she said. Beth in the kitchen with Charlotte (left) and Henry (right) before the cyclone tore their home apart . This was when Beth and Kris felt they had choice but to move their family and pets to the car parked in an open patio although they were far from certain it was the safest option. 'I was freaking out in the house because we had too many ceilings coming down on us but we didn't know if moving to the car was the smart decision,' Beth said. They decided that they would attempt to drive down the road to Kris's dad's farm. 'So while the car was shaking and rattling around we tried to move it forward a few hundred feet and no way - there was too much wind, it was so dark and it was crazy with trees and debris,' Beth said. 'We didn't know how much water was around and I couldn't handle it if the car started to slide away and I would somehow have to let my children out of their car seats. 'Also, my mum wasn't strong enough to be able to swim if we had to go through something so we decided to stay put.' Beth standing on the beautiful lush land before they began to build their dream home 18 months ago . Kris left and Beth's mum (right), with Henry in the high chair, having a drink to celebrate their first Australia Day on their new deck . So with the dogs in the tray in the back of the Ford Hilux and three adults and two children in the cabin they painstakingly sat tight from midnight until 5am. 'It was horrible, we were all cramped and sopping wet and the car was not sitting still - it was shaking violently but as soon as the sun came up we could see a clear path down to Kris's dad's farm so we drove down the hill very slowly,' she said. Miraculously even the pets survived with the dogs making it though the night in the back of the ute and the cat hid in a cupboard until morning. 'Kris and I looked at each other blankly the next night as if to say \"oh my goodness\".' The family moved from one room to the other as water rapidly filled up in every room of the new home . Beth said the determined spirit of the Vanuatu people after such an epic disaster was nothing short of phenomenal . Beth said they feel incredibly lucky to have survived the horrendous ordeal unscathed and could not bear the thought if anything had gone wrong . Beth said they feel incredibly lucky to have survived the horrendous ordeal unscathed and could not bear the thought if anything had gone wrong. 'I couldn't care less about the house - I was only concerned about the kids and mum and keeping them calm so they experienced the least impact,' she said. 'I was very nervous and freaking out about going in the car and then driving off and being washed away and I thought \"if I lose a child just let me be washed away too\". 'I was just terrified that something was going to happen to the children like a ceiling was going to fall in on them while I was saving the TV so I just stayed with them the whole time.' Now sharing one room at Kris's father's place, they expect to be back in their home, where the walls are still in tact, within the next six months. Charlotte has had a few nightmares since the ordeal but was a very brave girl and went back to school yesterday . The family won't be moving back in for up to six months and are currently all sleeping in one room at Kris's dad's farm . Beth won't be cooking in her kitchen anytime soon as it took the full brunt of the massive storm . The family got to spend just one Christmas in their new home before the cyclone wreaked havoc . Beth and Kris spent 18 months ensuring the house was cyclone proof (pictured being built) - the walls are still in tact . Beth urged people to donate to the help the island get back on its feet after the biggest natural disaster in its living memory .

'I just want to lie down with a magazine but you have to keep going - you can't stop in these situations.' She said the help and aid from Australia has been extremely overwhelming.

Tommy Schaefer, 21, and Heather Mack, 19, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court, where they are charged with premeditated murder for the death of Sheila von Wiese-Mack last August in Bali. They could face a firing squad if found guilty. The victim's bludgeoned body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi. Testifying at the trial of Mack, Schaefer told the court their relationship was not endorsed by his girlfriend's mother, and he went to Bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant. Scroll down for video . Break down: Heather Mack, from Chicago, weeps in a courtroom as she witnesses her trial in Bali, Indonesia on Thursday, March 12, 2015. Mack, 19, charged with premeditated murder in the death of her mother . Trial: Mack told the court her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer (right) killed her mother in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby . 'She attacked me': Schaeffer testified in court Thursday that the victim insulted him using a racial slur, described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man, and strangled him for 30 seconds . After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform von Wiese-Mack that Mack was  pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying. Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a 'precaution'. Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself. According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw that Mack's mother was screaming. 'She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,' Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears. Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony. He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man. He said the situation got heated when von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds. Heather Mack, 19, told an Indonesian court on Wednesday that her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, killed Shelia von Wiese-Mack (together-left) in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby . Heather Mack (left) and boyfriend Tommy Schaefer (right) arrive in court Thursday in Bali . Cuffed: Scaheffer says he was angry after victim threatened to kill his and Heather Mack's unborn baby . 'I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,' Schaefer said, in tears. He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn't breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother. He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States. In her first questioning in court on Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. 'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.' Von Wiese-Mack's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets. The suitcase was later found in a taxi at the posh St. Regis Hotel in August. Deceased: Shelia von Wiese-Mack's late husband, and her daughter's father, was composer James Mack . Pregnant: The couple, seen here together in an Instagram picture from last year, are expecting a child . Trial: According to the indictment, Schaefer battered von Wiese-Mack with the metal bowl following an argument over the hotel bill . Heather Mack (left) and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, from Chicago, Illinois, sit in a cell before a trial in Bali . Mack said when she left the bathroom, she found Schaefer on the bed trying to give her artificial respiration. 'Tommy said my mother was not breathing,' she said. Mack said she also tried to revive her but it didn't work. She said they panicked and thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the U.S. Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. 'We panicked and didn't know what to do,' she said. Mack answered 'no' when the judge asked whether she wished her mother dead. 'Troubled': Mack has previously been described as 'troubled' and 'violent' by friends of her family .

Heavily pregnant Mack (right), 19, and Tommy Schaefer (second from left), 21, sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of von Wiese-Mack . Mack and Schaefer arrived in court, handcuffed together and wearing matching orange waistcoats. The pair sat in court in front of evidence believed to be a suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of Mack's 62-year-old mother. According to the indictment, Schaefer battered von Wiese-Mack with a fruit bowl handle in her room following an argument over the hotel bill. It says Mack helped stuff her mother's body into the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it. The indictment says they then placed the suitcase in the trunk of a taxi and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. Hotel security guards are said to have seen blood spots on the grey suitcase and the taxi driver went to the police, who then made the gruesome discovery. The pair were wearing matching orange waistcoats as they arrived for their latest court appearance on Wednesday . Sheila Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel . The first witness to testify at Schaefer's trial, a bellboy named Arifin, said he saw the couple taking a suitcase on a baggage cart toward the lobby on August 12. He said during proceedings in February that he asked them about the hotel bill, which according to a receptionist hadn't been paid, but Mack refused to respond. 'They asked me to call a taxi, but they refused when I offered to help put the bag into the taxi,' he said. 'They argued that the contents were fragile, and refused to be assisted.' Arifin, who uses a single name, said he heard about the murder later from police. The second witness was I Putu Adi Marta, a technician who examined the hotel's security videos on August 12. 'I was asked to check because a couple, a man and a woman, were said to have escaped without paying the hotel bill,' he said. Marta said the video recordings showed that Schaefer and Mack used the emergency stairs several times to go between the third and sixth floors. Mack and her mother were staying in a room on the third floor, while Schaefer was staying on the sixth floor. 'The man walked up and down from the third to the sixth floor, changed his shirt once and brought a white cloth,' he said. 'They also were shown bringing a large package from the third to the sixth floor.' The pair (pictured together in a cell), from Chicago, Illinois, are being tried separately by the Denpasar District Court . A police officer also testified that he was among five police who arrested the couple on August 13 at the Bali Wisata Hotel in the Kuta area, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the St. Regis hotel. 'First they refused to be taken without being accompanied by lawyers from their government,' I Made Ariyana said. He said they also refused to talk or be photographed at the Kuta police station. Schaefer did not object to any of the testimony. Prosecutors said before visiting Bali, Mack had suggested that Schaefer hire someone for $50,000 to kill her mother, who objected to their relationship. Mack and her mother had arrived first in Bali and were staying in a room on the third floor of the hotel, while Schaefer arrived later and was staying on the sixth floor.

Mitchelle Blair, 35, was arrested Tuesday after court officers serving an eviction notice at her home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry. The county medical examiner was hoping to conduct autopsies on the children's bodies Wednesday but had to wait until they had fully thawed. The police, meanwhile, weren't saying much about their investigation into the circumstances surrounding the children's deaths and the conditions in the home near downtown Detroit, where Blair's other two children had also been living. 'While we all understand the desire to know what happened in that home is strong, I will ask you to be mindful of the two children who were also in that home and are still living,' Detroit Police Chief James Craig told reporters Wednesday. 'They've been through a lot, a tremendous trauma.' Scroll down for video . Mother: 35-year-old Mitchelle Blair, who two children were found dead in a deep freezer in their home, was charged with child abuse Wednesday . Daughter: Blair's daughter, Stoni Ann Blair, is seen with her father Alexander Dorsey. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive . Court officers serving an eviction notice at Blair's home opened the freezer and found the bodies of her daughter Stoni Ann Blair and her son Stephen Gage Berry . Prosecutors believe that when they died, Stoni was 13 years old and Stephen was 9. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive, and Stephen would have been 11. Police are seen Tuesday . A woman walks past notes left on the door at at the family's home on Wednesday . The two surviving children, a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy, were placed in protective custody on Tuesday. Blair is charged with five counts of first-degree child abuse, one of which could land her in prison for life, said Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutor's office. She may face further charges after the autopsies are completed. Prosecutors believe that when they died, Stoni was 13 years old and Stephen was 9. Stoni would have been 15 now, if alive, and Stephen would have been 11. Neighbors said they hadn't seen the dead children in about a year. None of the four children was enrolled in Detroit schools, and friends said their mother was home-schooling them. Under state law, Michigan parents have the right to homeschool their children. Educating them, assigning homework and testing are the parent's responsibility. Registering the home school to the state Education office is voluntary, unless the student is special needs and special education services have been requested from the local school district. The state was not notified that Blair's children were being homeschooled this year, said Education Department spokesman Bill Disessa. Neighbors say Blair has lived in the complex at least 10 years. She was unemployed and having money troubles, and she had gotten behind on her rent. Neighbors said they knew about the impending eviction. Court records show a judgment filed last month against her for $2,206 owed to the complex. Despite her money and other problems, friends call her a good mother. Blair is known throughout the complex of low-income townhomes as 'Angel' - a play on her middle name, Angela, that she got because she is so well-liked, said neighbors Carrie McDonald and Shay Wilson. 'The mother is a beautiful person. She was just going through some things,' McDonald said. 'She has a good heart.' But neighbors rarely saw the four children outdoors. Some say they hadn't seen Stoni and Stephen for about a year. 'She really don't let them outside,' said Wilson. 'They are always in the house.' In announcing the charges against Blair, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said 'the alleged facts in this case present examples of why we must all be diligent and involved citizens.' Blair allegedly confessed to the murder of her two children, according to a police source . It has been claimed that Blair allegedly confessed to strangling her son in May 2012, according to WXYZ, who are quoting a police source. She is also said to have admitted torturing her daughter to death just nine months later,  the news channel reported. Police were called in by the bailiffs after they discovered the girl's body in the chest freezer next to the front door. Her sibling's corpse was found later. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the mother was taken into custody after an apartment resident informed officers she was staying with someone at a different home inside the complex, according to the Detroit News. Craig said the mother was handcuffed when she was taken into custody. Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. Blair posted a photo with a message in January . On January 30, the posted a photo with a message. It read: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' Before she was taken into custody, the mother reportedly said her son was raped and that the sexual assault had been carried out by his siblings. Police have not confirmed that is the case and it is unclear if she was talking about the boy who was found in the freezer. She filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support. Blair filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result. Her brother Marlon Blair told the Detroit News earlier this week: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments. 'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.' Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt told the Detroit News earlier this week it appeared the bodies had been in the freezer for 'over a year' and that the mother had been living in the apartment 'with other children while the bodies were in the freezer'. 'This is a terrible situation,' he said. No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched and police do not yet have a motive. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, told the Detroit News Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. Lanier told the newspaper: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house. 'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.' Craig said the Detroit News that police were still 'trying to determine what happened'. The cause of death won't be known until after autopsies are conducted. Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home. 'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' Toni Williams, 28, left, and Natasha Bell, 30, leave balloons at the house on Wednesday . A neighbor, Tori Childs (center), was led away from the scene as law enforcement investigated on Tuesday . The two surviving children, a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy, were placed in protective custody on Tuesday . Lanier told the Detroit News said her sister received a phone call around 6am on Tuesday from a woman who lives inside the apartment. The woman asked to stay at Lanier's sister's home with her two children that day, according to Lanier, and was there when the bodies were found. Police initially reported that they had a discovered a single body in the freezer.",

'When you've got the Iranians and the Cubans doing terrible things to their people, you don't give them ice cream and candy for heaven's sake,' former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said after the event's host, Bruce Rastetter, a major player in the renewable energy sector, asked him if he supported the opening of trade with communist country. Responding to the same question during his 20-min Q and A with Rastetter, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie referenced  Black Liberation Army member Joanne Chesimard and argued that the U.S. shouldn't be trading with a country that is 'promoting someone who is a cop-killer.' Scroll down for video . 'When you've got the Iranians and the Cubans doing terrible things to their people, you don't give them ice cream and candy for heavens sake,' former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said while discussing trade at the Iowa Ag summit on Saturday . The Des Moines, Iowa, event was Bruce Rastetter, a major player in the renewable energy sector. Protesters are seen here outside the all-day extravaganza that attracted top-tier presidential hopefuls. Rastetter is pictured here wearing a crown in a protest sign . Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry said President Barack Obama 'really missed the point' of sanctions on Cuba and had 'basically empowered the Castro regime' by renewing high-level diplomatic relations. 'This is a regime that has been incredibly onerous to the people of Cuba,' the 2012 presidential candidate said. If the point of the shift in Cuba policy was to put the country's people in a 'better position,' Perry said, Obama's plan failed. 'I'm not sure you're ever going to change the culture of Cuba until Castro is dead and gone,' Perry said, not specifying whether he was talking about the country's previous dictator Fidel, or his brother, Raul, who now runs the country. 'I think we got a bad deal. I think the Cuban people got a bad deal,' he said, stressing that the exchange of three Cuban spies for aid worker Alan Gross' release wasn't enough. 'In my opinion, we got the way short end of that deal,' Perry added. Huckabee said that the U.S. should 'quit pretending that Cuba is some wonderful nation with whom we can sit down and visit with any more than the Iranians are.' 'They're not,' Huckabee, a 2008 GOP presidential contender and likely 2016 competitor, he stated 'These are untrustworthy people who never kept an agreement in their lives.' Furthermore, Huckabee, said they, 'they kick their people in the groin.' 'You don't go around making plans to be nice to people who do horrible things,' he argued during an extended critique of the current occupant of the Oval Office's relations with foreign governments. 'You put pressure on them, you don't release the pressure.' Continuing, he said, 'I mean, my gosh, if my parents had raised me that way, I'd be a monster. 'My parents corrected my bad behavior. They didn't encourage it by rewarding me with ice cream and candy every time I did something horrible.' Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry is interviewed by host Rastetter, right. Perry said President Barack Obama 'really missed the point' of sanctions on Cuba and had 'basically empowered the Castro regime' by renewing high-level diplomatic relations. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie referenced Black Liberation Army member Joanne Chesimard and argued that the U.S. shouldn't be trading with a country that is 'promoting someone who is a cop-killer.' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he is an 'emphatic advocate of free trade' but doesn't support it with Cuba. 'The Castros have been brutal dictators,' he said. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said 'any efforts taken by the Obama administration right now have not gotten anything in return.' 'Cuban dissidents are still in prison. The economy is controlled by a handful of what we would call, basically party apparatchiks. In the regime there's no small business development,' he asserted. 'All the economy built up by Cuba – the simple fact is it looks more like North Korea than a country that's emerging toward a freer place,' he claimed. Bush said a 'better approach would have been to say to Cuba, to the regime, \"You make these changes and of course we will open up diplomatic relations. Of course we will open up trade.\" ' That would ultimately create 'great opportunities.' 'But right now this is not something that we should be doing unless there's big-time changes in Cuba,' he concluded. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he is an 'emphatic advocate of free trade' but, 'I don't support it with regard to Cuba.' 'The Castros have been brutal dictators,' he said, and 'they are exporting terrorism throughout the hemisphere.' Last year, Cuba was caught trying to send a shipment of arms to North Korea. Pyongyang recently paid a nearly $700,000 fine to the Panama Canal Authority for attempting to traffic arms. 'We've gotta be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,' the freshman lawmaker said. President Obama's actions will 'directly prop up the Castros,' Cruz said. Noting that he would be 'thrilled' to open up trade with Cuba, Cruz said he would only support it 'once we see freedom returned to the nation of Cuba.' That means free elections and free speech, he explained. FUGITIVE: JoAnne Chesimard killed a New Jersey police officer, escaped from a New Jersey prison and fled justice in Cuba, where she still lives under the Raul Castro government's protection . 'The simple fact is it looks more like North Korea than a country that's emerging toward a freer place,' former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said of Cuba . Christie said the U.S. shouldn't be doing any business with Cuba until it stops harboring a fugitive who killed a New Jersey police officer in 1977. 'You cannot start trading with a country that is promoting someone who is a cop-killer,' he said of Chesimard. The 67-year-old escaped from a New Jersey prison in 1979 and has been hiding out in Cuba since at least 1984, when Fidel Castro's regime granted her asylum. 'If they're going to keep harboring fugitives,' he said, 'I have a problem with that ... The president doesn't know how to negotiate. You don't give away the idea of trading with America for nothing.' Raul Castro's regime refused last week to extradite Chesimard, who now goes by the name of Assata Olugbala Shakur. 'I can say it is off the table,' Gustavo Machin, deputy director for American affairs at the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Yahoo News while discussing the latest round of trade negotiations between the U.S. and his country. Josefina Vidal, Cuba’s Head Of North American Affairs, had previously rejected a deal that would have released five Cuban prisoners being held in the U.S. if his country handed over Chesimard. 'Every nation has sovereign and legitimate rights to grant political asylum to people it considers to have been persecuted,' she told the Associated Press in December. 'We’ve explained to the U.S. government in the past that there are some people living in Cuba to whom Cuba has legitimately granted political asylum.' Both Texas politicians who spoke at the summit said that unlike Cuba, they support trade with China. China is different, Perry said, because it basically practices communism at night and capitalism in day time. Cruz, who spoke after Perry, said that 'with China you can make direct investment.' 'You can directly trade with the people,' which you can't do in Cuba, where workers paid just eight cents of every dollar, Cruz said.",

        "input_text": "Trendy winter coat manufacturer Canada Goose is being accused of being cruel to animals and covering up the truth about it, Daily Mail Online can disclose. The hugely successful maker of fur-lined coats is the subject of legal action claiming that it has deliberately deceived consumers, exploited animal welfare concerns with disingenuous marketing and concealed the reality of chilling cruelty and animal suffering on which their multi-million dollar business is built. The shocking allegations are made against the manufacturer in a legal complaint filed against the company last week in Canada. The complaint has been filed by Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund and calls for independent law enforcement agency the Competition Bureau of Canada to 'investigate Canada Goose for its multiple intentional misrepresentations.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fashion forward: Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton is one of the many celebrities who have helped make Canada Goose the must-have winter brand . Caught: Campaigners claim coyotes trapped and skinned for their fur to trim the hoods of Canada Goose coats can be in pain for days. It is unclear whether these images are from Canada Goose trappers but the firm does use the same leg holds . Ugly: Exhausted, alone and all out of fight, this Coyote awaits its inevitable fate having been caught in a trap by its right hind leg . Fan following: Krysten Ritter models one of the coats with coyote fur-lined hoods. The brand is diversifying into other apparel too, such as the down jacket worn by Hugh Jackman (right) Endorsed: The company is marketed by British celebrity Ben Fogle, who presents Ben Fogle's Animal Clinic and has spoken out on other animal cruelty issues including the killing of rhinos and the killing of zoo animals . Canada Goose has become one of the most recognizable brands when it comes to winter jacket, coats and parkas. They have made America their new frontier, forging into the US clothing market with worldwide sales topping $176 million last year - up 4,000 per cent in a decade. In November last year it opened its own store in West Chelsea, one of New York's most prestigious shopping areas, and it also sells at high-end stores such as Barney's, Bergdorf Goodman,, Bloomingdales and Neiman Marcus.. Earlier this year it opened a new factory in Toronto to cope with soaring demand. Celebrities are regularly seen wearing the trademark coyote fur-trimmed, down jackets and the brand has established itself as the go-to label for the well-known and the well-heeled braving the frigid conditions that continue to bite. Last year's Sports Illustrated cover featured Kate Upton wearing a Canada Goose jacket and little else. Other celebrities seen wearing the brand have included Hugh Jackman, the Wolverine star, and Sports Illustrated model Erin Heatherton. It is endorsed by Ben Fogle, the British animal television show presenter, who has also spoken out against animal cruelty. But according to the legal complaint, seen by Daily Mail Online, consumers are being duped into thinking they are making either an ethical choice or buying the best product when they purchase Canada Goose. In the document Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund has accused the company of, 'engaging in a persistent pattern of using deceptive practices to market its winter jackets by repeatedly misleading consumers with respect to the nature and quality of its jackets which include coyote fur.' The complaint attacks Canada Goose on its claims that the coyote fur used in its jackets is in any way ethically or humanely obtained. Distressed: A coyote is caught in a snare of the same type used by Canada Goose trappers . Snared: Campaigners claim that coyotes caught like this can take days to die . Canada Goose's website claims that the company is 'deeply committed to the preservation of our global environment and the humane treatment of animals.' It goes on, 'We never purchase fur from fur farms, never use fur from endangered animals, and only purchase from certified Canadian trappers.' These trappers are governed by the Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards (AIHTS) and their pelts are purchased by Canada Goose through North American Fur Auctions (NAFA). According to Canada Goose the NAFA 'monitors very closely' the practices of the trappers selling through it. According to Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund it does nothing of the sort. Instead, they claim: 'There is no mechanism within the NAFA to provide any degree of oversight of the trapping practices of the trappers from which NAFA accepts consignment pelts.' NAFA, it states, does not monitor trappers. It is not an oversight body; it is a commercial fur auction house. Nor does the AIHTS bring the guarantee of humane methods explicit in Canada Goose's claims. The AIHTS simply requires Canada to 'phase out' certain types of traps – traps, Animal Justice Canada claims, that are still used by the trappers selling to Canada Goose. What Canada Goose says: The FAQs on the firm's website form part of the animal rights group's case against the successful manufacturer. They say that the trappers are not monitored to be sure that act humanely . Design classic: Canada Goose's women's Trillium Coat in military green . In demand: The company predicts double digit sales growth for the foreseeable future . And so while consumers believe every effort is being made to ensure that the fur they are wearing when they buy a Canada Goose coat has been secured with minimal animal suffering and maximum human oversight, they are, Animal Justice Canada insists, being deceived. Coyotes are caught in leg hold traps that inflict injuries including fractures, severance of tendons and ligaments, severe bleeding, spinal cord injury, organ damage and amputation of limbs. Despite these horrific injuries the animal may survive long enough to be clubbed, suffocated or strangled to death by the trapper.To dispatch an animal swiftly with a bullet would spoil the pelt. Body gripping traps and snares - metal nooses - are also used inflicting similar injury and failing to deliver the swift 'humane' death implied in Canada Goose's marketing material. The Fur Institute of Canada, which promotes the interests of the fur industry, believes a 'humane' death is on that occurs within 300 seconds. According to Animal Justice Canada: '..under laboratory conditions, it takes approximately eight minutes … for a snare to strangle a coyote – three minutes longer than what even the fur industry itself claims to be humane.' As for the company's assertion that they do not use the pelt of endangered species, Animal Justice Canada points out that the traps set for coyotes are indiscriminate in the animals they capture. Marketing: Canada Goose uses Canada's Arctic Circle to highlight the warmth of its jackets . More fans: Jodie Foster (left) keeps warm in a Canada Goose jacket while filming in New York, while Olivia Wilde wears one to run errands in the city . Key among Canada Goose's defense of their use of real fur is their insistence that in, 'the coldest places on Earth…fur is not just the best choice, but the only choice.' Speaking on their website, Danny Reis, the president and CEO of Canada Goose, explains: 'We use coyote fur for a number of reasons. Number one, coyote fur works. It's functional; it provides warmth around the face in a way that no synthetic fabric can. It does that in the coldest environments in earth, and it's important to realize that sometimes urban centers and cities can feel like the coldest places on earth.' We're confident in both why we use fur and how it is sourced, and people should know this is not something we take lightly. Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry. Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that. We also understand that despite the fact that numerous brands also use real fur in their products and do not attempt to explain their position, it is our very openness and transparency around this subject that makes Canada Goose a target for activist groups whose views will never align with ours. We are proud to support an industry practice that supports northern and rural communities in Canada, and of our continued role as an educator on this matter. The narrator then states: 'Coyote fur, unlike fake fur, doesn't hold moisture, retains heat and is biodegradable.' In its legal complaint Animal Justice Canada says: 'There is no scientific proof to support Canada Goose's claim that coyote fur is more protective of the face, in a way that 'no synthetic material' can be.' This is not the first time Canada Goose has fallen foul of animal rights campaigners. Last year Daily Mail Online revealed that People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was calling for the company to stop using coyote fur and to stop supporting the trapping of animals, 'in a way that is inherently cruel.' Speaking to Daily Mail Online then Lindsay Rajt, Director of Campaigns for PETA described the horrific reality of animal trapping. She said: 'The company's reference to AIHTS standards is meaningless and a way of placating and silencing people with valid concerns. 'Leg hold traps are still legal in Canada. Mothers will chew off their limbs in order to get back to their young. The trapped animal might be there for days before the trapper finds them. They are frightened and starving and in pain during that time. And then they're bludgeoned or strangled to death.' Additionally PETA has called for the company to replace its goose down – which is obtained as a by-product of the poultry industry - and opt for 'revolutionary synthetic technology' already used by competitor, North Face. But according to Ms Rajt PETA's repeated attempts to meet with Canada Goose have been stonewalled. Now, Animal Justice Canada Legislative Fund, has called for the Competition Bureau to investigate the company for its 'multiple intentional misrepresentations on its website.' And it has urged the body to 'take all appropriate enforcement action to ensure that Canada Goose is accountable' for the 'false and misleading information that it has willfully directed at consumers.' Canada Goose said that it rejected any claims it had misinformed customers but said it could never satisfy activists entirely opposed to fur. A spokesman said: 'Our company is built on honesty and authenticity so we have gone to great lengths to be as open as possible about why we use fur on our products, how it is sourced, and the government-regulated practices of the Canadian fur industry. 'Like many proud Canadians, we don't believe that the humane killing of animals for functional purpose is wrong. We understand and deeply respect that not everyone agrees with that.'",

Steven Timothy Snyder was convicted in 1996 of disorderly conduct in Fond du Lac, the same city where he killed Trooper Trevor Casper on Tuesday. A third person was also found dead, but police have not said who was responsible. Shootout: Steven Timothy Snyder, left, killed rookie Trooper Trevor Casper, right, on Tuesday . Crime: According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Snyder robbed a bank in the Village of Wausaukee, a community in northeastern Wisconsin just a few miles from the Michigan border, early Tuesday afternoon . According to charging documents, Snyder, then 19, was part of a group of skinheads police noticed walking through downtown in April 1996. Police saw the group walk up to a house. A group of black and Hispanic people emerged and the two groups pulled out pipes and baseball bats and began swinging at each other. The groups dispersed as police arrived, and an officer chased Snyder down and captured him. The documents say he had several 'White Power' tattoos and was carrying several dozen printed cards in his coat promoting a neo-Nazi organization called the National Alliance. The cards contained messages such as, 'That no multi-racial society is a healthy society — that if the white race is to survive we must unite our people on the basis of common blood, organize them within a progressive social order, and inspire them with a common set of ideals,' the charging documents said. Snyder told officers that some of the black and Hispanic people who came out of the house were carrying guns. The documents listed Snyder's address as Macomb Township, near Detroit. Alone: Casper had just graduated from the State Patrol's academy in December and was on his first solo patrol on Tuesday when the fatal shootout took place . Remembered: A funeral for Casper will be held Sunday at his alma mater, Kiel High School. A private burial is scheduled Monday .

Online court records don't list any other charges against Snyder in Wisconsin. According to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Snyder robbed a bank in the Village of Wausaukee, a community in northeastern Wisconsin just a few miles from the Michigan border, early Tuesday afternoon. Later that evening the 21-year-old Casper, who had just graduated from the State Patrol's academy in December and was on his first solo patrol, began following a vehicle in Fond du Lac that matched the description of the one used in the Wausaukee robbery. Casper ultimately got into a shootout with Snyder and both were fatally wounded, according to Department of Justice officials. The agency has released no other details and an investigation is ongoing. Meanwhile, Marinette County authorities said Wausaukee resident Thomas C. Christ was found dead Tuesday. They said Christ had been shot after an encounter with Snyder near Christ's property. The FBI and the state are investigating whether Snyder may be involved in other bank robberies in other states. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that a Fond du Lac bank was robbed around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, but Fond du Lac police said Thursday that investigators have found no evidence directly linking Snyder to that robbery. A funeral for Casper will be held Sunday at his alma mater, Kiel High School. A private burial is scheduled Monday.

'I am not requesting of Indonesia anything that Indonesia does not request of other nations where Indonesian citizens face the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told the Telegraph. 'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' she said in the Australian Parliament recently. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine pair Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan (left to right) , will have a legal appeal against their execution sentence heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday . 'We urge the Indonesian government to show the same mercy to Andrew and Myuran as it seeks for its citizens in the same situation abroad,' Australia's Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop told Parliament recently . With an estimated 360 Indonesians facing the death penalty abroad - about 230 of those on drug charges - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has warned Indonesia's plans to proceed with the Bali Nine executions could risk the lives of its own citizens. Ms Bishop pointed to the case of Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad, an Indonesian maid who was saved  from beheading in Saudi Arabia by the previous Indonesian government after being convicted of murdering her elderly employer. It's reported Indonesia paid $2.1 million to stop the execution and that President Joko Widodo was among the politicians calling for mercy at the time. While President Widodo lobbies for his own people, he continues to reject Australia's appeals for clemency for the Bali Nine pair. Widodo told Al Jazeera Televsion that  his role, as Head of State, is to protect his citizens. 'But at the same time, we have to respect other countries that apply capital punishment,' he said. Last year, Indonesia made a substantial payment to a Saudi family to halt the impending execution of Indonesian maid, Satinah Binti Jumadi Ahmad.  Her sister-in-law, Sulastri, holds her photo in Central Java last year . Last month, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi told theJakarta Post that the Indonesian government was committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals  on death row around the world. 'The state is giving assistance by providing them with lawyers and regular visits in the prisons and carrying out diplomatic efforts with local authorities to solve the issue,' Retno told reporters. She also said President Widodo had ordered all Indonesian embassies and consulates 'to unite the death row convicts with their families as this would be helpful for their psychological well-being.' Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi says Indonesia is committed to helping release 229 Indonesian nationals on death row around the world - despite refusing to grant clemency to Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran . Ms Bishop told the Australian Parliament last month that Indonesian organisations like  Migrant Care and the National Commission on Human Rights, say Indonesia's  policy of proceeding with executions at home 'would risk undermining its representations abroad.' Of Chan and Sukumaran, she said Australia will not give up hope. 'The families of these two young Australian men have spoken openly and in heartbreaking terms of their hopes for a stay of execution,' Ms Bishop said. 'The Australian government stands resolutely with both families, after all, Australia is only doing what Indonesia is doing: making representations on behalf of Indonesian families in support of Indonesian death row prisoners abroad.' 'I believe it is Indonesia that will lose the most from executing these two young men.' The legal appeal for condemned Bali Nine pair Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran will be heard in a Jakarta court on Thursday. It comes after Friday's news that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's executions have been indefinitely delayed due to ongoing legal proceedings. The delay and new appeal have been welcomed by the pair's legal team, as well as Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, both of whom have voiced their optimism at the prospect for a repeal to the execution sentence, reports Yahoo News. The new appeal will be the men's second challenge to the clemency bid which was rejected in January. Julian McMahon (C), the lawyer for Bali Nine pair. The condemned Australian's legal team said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of the Indonesian Government' Michael O'Connell, one of the lawyers for the two Australians, said the delay was a 'welcome development' as it represented a change to the previous position of Indonesian attorney-general Muhammad Prasetyo. 'The indications that we've had yesterday are encouraging because there does now appear to be some regard to his principles.' Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped the appeal represented a possible shift in the stance of the Indonesian government. 'There could be other reasons for the delay but I hope, in my heart, that it's a change of mind,' she said. Drug trafficker Scott Rush is led away for interrogation at Bali Police Headquarters. The now 29 year old has voiced his sympathy for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran after hearing they will face the firing squad . It comes after Scott Rush- one of the Bali Nine members who had his sentence changed from death to life in prison-has spoken out about his sympathy for the pair. Rush, 29, told The Weekend Australian via a friend he was 'shocked and heartbroken' by news of the their fate. 'I am praying for Myuran and Andrew and for the other condemned prisoners that even at this time mercy can't be shown,' he said. 'I send love and prayers to the families and loved ones. May God bless them all,' Mr Rush reportedly said. One of the Brisbane man's lawyers said that while his client was saddened by the destiny of the condemned duo, the reports he felt guilty were inaccurate. Scroll down for video .

But it isn't more royal duties that most have in mind. Instead, more than half say the Prince should combine official work with an 'ordinary' job. Harry is currently a captain in the Blues and Royals but will leave the Army this summer after a stint seconded to the Australian Defence Force. New job: The majority of Britons think Prince Harry should get another 'ordinary' job . Retirement: Harry announced that he will leave the Army this summer earlier this week . Deployment: Harry, who did two tours of duty in Afghanistan, will now spend four weeks with the Australian Defence Force in Sydney and Perth . The 30-year-old is due to fly to Australia next month and will follow his month-long deployment with an official tour of New Zealand. He will also travel back to this side of the world half way through to mark the Gallipoli centenary at a ceremony in Turkey alongside the Prince of Wales. Despite calls for the Prince to get a regular job, the majority of Britons say leaving the Army is the right decision. 56 per cent of those questioned by pollsters YouGov said the royal has made the right choice, compared to just eight per cent opposed. Harry, who has consistently topped royal popularity polls, was also deemed a good role model by the majority of those asked, with 61 per cent saying he is. An enthusiastic 22 per cent said the Prince is a 'very good' role model, with just four per cent saying he is a bad one and two per cent opting for 'very bad'. Although only 16 per cent believe Harry should concentrate exclusively on royal duties, his future beyond next autumn remains unclear. Along with announcing his decision to leave the Army, a statement from Kensington Palace revealed the Prince will travel to Africa this summer to take part in conservation and charity work. Yesterday, it was revealed that Harry will follow that with participation in the 1,000 mile 'Walk of Britain' alongside injured soldiers supported by Walking with the Wounded. The trek will be the third Walking with the Wounded expedition for Harry, who previously joined servicemen battling their way to the North Pole in 2011 and the South Pole in 2013. Next stop: Harry, pictured with the Kiwi Invictus team last September, will also tour New Zealand . Royal duties: Most think Harry should combine official work (pictured) with a regular job . Role model: Harry, who regularly tops royal popularity charts, is also considered a good role model by most . Speaking at the event yesterday, Harry reiterated his commitment to helping wounded veterans and also revealed that leaving the military would be 'challenging' for him. 'The public’s support for our Armed Forces continues to be extraordinary,' he added.

        "input_text": "She was everything to me: David Robb with wife Briony McRoberts at a social event in 2012 . Nestled with the many photos and mementos of his 35-year marriage lies a letter that Downton Abbey actor David Robb wishes he had never had to read. Written by a stranger, its contents are unimaginable to most of us. Yet for David it has provided some small semblance of comfort following the suicide of his wife Briony McRoberts, recounting, as it does, the last minutes of her life. For, while on screen the distinguished actor has become a global star as Downton's Dr Richard Clarkson – keeping millions of fans guessing if his unrequited love for Isobel Crawley might end in marriage – in private, for the past 18 months he has been struggling to come to terms with Briony's death. On July 17, 2013, the woman he thought of as his rock left home and jumped in front of a train at Fulham Broadway station. She was 56. 'She was the most gentle of people – she hated it if I had even a minor altercation with anyone, so the idea that she could have done this, inflict that on herself, is something I cannot comprehend,' he says softly. Work and the close friendship of the Downton cast members – who have become like a second family to him during the past five years – has helped. 'A little squeeze on the shoulder from Maggie Smith as she leaves the make-up trailer is enough to show me I have wonderful support,' he says. 'Briony would sometimes come to Downton Abbey get-togethers with me, and became friends with the actresses Laura Carmichael and Michelle Dockery. People were attracted to Briony, she was such a vibrant person.' Like so many suicides, there was no note, no inkling of the tragedy to come. Two nights before her death she was at a drinks party swapping numbers with friends. There was even a holiday marked in the diary. 'I certainly don't believe that, when we were at the party, she was thinking she would be dead in a couple of days,' says David, who met his wife in 1975 when she was 18 and they starred together in a West End play. They married in 1978. The letter about Briony's death came from a woman who had witnessed the suicide. 'It was the most beautiful letter from a lady who had been standing beside her on the platform,' recalls David 67. 'She told me that Briony was calm, didn't seem distressed in anyway, looked almost serene. 'As the train came in it seemed as if Briony was looking over the track as if she had lost something, and then she was gone.' The actress's career had taken off when she was 19, playing Wendy Darling in a musical adaptation of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan starring Mia Farrow and Danny Kaye. She went on to star in a string of TV hits including The Professionals, Heartbeat, EastEnders and Scottish drama Take The High Road. On screen: David as Dr Clarkson in Downton Abbey with Penelope Wilton as Isobel Crawley . Briony suffered from anorexia as a teenager – something David attributes to the death of her mother from pneumonia when she was seven. But it wasn't until she turned 50 that her eating disorder returned. Ironically, as David's career flourished with the success of Downton, his wife felt hers was over, something he believes triggered the anorexia. 'It is like alcoholism,' he maintains. 'You can not touch a drink for 50 years, but you are still an alcoholic. It might have gone into mental remission for years but it was still there'. Her close friend, actress Joanna Lumley, warned Briony she would die unless she sought help when her weight dropped to six-and-a-half stone – severely underweight for her 5ft 7in frame. 'Briony felt washed up, that no one remembered her and no matter how much I reassured her she felt worthless, a failure,' David says. 'Of course she wasn't, but that is what this business can do to you, especially if you are a woman.' David admits relations between them had been strained the night before her death. 'We were meeting friends at a pub in Putney and when I arrived Briony had already had a drink,' he says. 'Being anorexic I knew she had to eat before she had a drink otherwise the alcohol was fast-acting so I was policing her for the rest of the evening. 'Walking back home later that evening, she pressed me, trying to have an argument and I wasn't having it so we were a bit sniffy with each other, but it was nothing more serious than that. 'We got up a bit earlier than usual because we had the decorators in, but Briony was doing her usual morning exercises. As she did her sit-ups, I even remember stepping over her at one point to get ready in the bathroom. 'I heard the front door close and assumed she'd gone for a long walk to clear her head. I knew she was going to meet friends to see a matinee performance in Chichester.' David, who recently played Sir Thomas Boleyn in the BBC's adaptation of Wolf Hall, admits he initially became concerned when he heard Briony's mobile phone ring. 'I'd no idea she hadn't taken it with her until I saw a text saying, 'Darling, where are you, we are in the bar?' ' he continues. Then at 4pm the police arrived with the news that Briony was dead. Warning: Briony with close friend and actress Joanna Lumley, who was worried about her friend . 'All she had on her was her wedding ring and my Oyster card [for the Underground],' he recalls. 'I understood what had happened but my heart just couldn't believe she'd done it. I remember thinking who the hell was I living my life with all these years.' The days and months that followed were a blur. 'Initially you are on auto-pilot, my friends and neighbours looked after me – every morning at 8.15am one would arrive with a coffee and a croissant,' David admits. 'Then I began to over-socialise and drink like a fish. Luckily I don't have an addictive gene and I stopped that. There were also days when I had the feeling that I just didn't want to wake up. 'Somehow you settle into a kind of rhythm and you just stagger on.' With his on-screen success, the couple were more financially secure than they'd been for years and David believed they had reached a stage in their life where they could look forward to their future. The guilt, however unwarranted, is relentless. 'It doesn't matter how much I know intellectually that it was not my fault, there is something at the heart of me that believes if I'd maybe told her I loved her more or noticed some small sign, anything...' Sweethearts: David and Briony had starred in a West End play together and were married for 35 years . Slowly David's life is changing to accommodate the new normality forced upon him, and the loss of equilibrium in his life which he is not sure he will ever get back. He is anxious not to be defined by Briony's death and the normally private actor agreed to speak to The Mail on Sunday only to highlight a moving BBC documentary which shows the devastating aftermath for family left behind after a suicide. David, who has volunteered with the Samaritans since 1987, had no doubts about returning to work there six months after Briony's death. 'Initially when I went back I wasn't on the phones, but gradually I started dealing with calls again,' he reveals. 'Maybe I have a greater understanding when someone calls to talk now, I am perhaps more aware of the little triggers.' Sadly, many of his memories of the woman who captured his heart with her charismatic personality and sparkling laughter have started to fade. 'I can't imagine cuddling her any more and I don't feel her presence anywhere – that spiritual connection, it's gone,' he says. David admits to missing the intimacy of a relationship – 'I hate the idea of being a single, old bloke' – but says Briony is an almost impossible act to follow, adding: 'She was everything to me.'",

At 68 and after a full and varied career which has taken in modeling for Vogue, an Oscar-nomination and countless Emmys for her hit TV show Murphy Brown, Candice Bergen says she is happy being fat and now lives to eat. In her new memoir, A Fine Romance, the living legend estimates she has put on 30 pounds in the past 15 years, but says she simply doesn't care. 'In the past 15 years... I have put on 30 pounds. I live to eat. None of this \"eat to live\" stuff for me. I am a champion eater. No carb is safe — no fat, either,' she readily admits. 'At a recent dinner party I shared bread and olive oil, followed by chocolate ice cream with my husband. A woman near me looked at me, appalled, and I thought, \"I don't care,\"' she writes. Women over 50 typically have to choose between preserving either their face or their butts and she writes that she has happily chosen the former. 'Dieting is out of my purview,' she confesses. 'I crave cookies... all the things that dilate my pupils.' Her skinny friends and their constant battles to remain thin only reinforce her belief that she is doing what is right for her. 'They maintain their weight by routinely vomiting after major meals consisting of a slice of steak or a filet of fish,' she writes. 'I am incapable of this.' In her new book, A Fine Romance, Candice Bergen talks at her joy at playing feisty TV reporter Murphy Brown for 10 seasons.  'She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless,' she writes . The brutally honest appraisal of her current weight is just one of the topics up for discussioin in her new book, which comes out on April 7, reports Vogue. The follow-up to her 1984 memoir Knock Wood, A Fine Romance focuses on her 15-year marriage to French director Louis Malle who died of cancer in 1995 and her career-defining role as funny, feisty career woman and TV news reporter Murphy Brown. The hit TV show ran for ten seasons between 1989 and 1998 and Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five. After her fifth win, Bergen declined future nominations for the role. Initially she writes that she wasn't thrilled at the idea of acting in a TV show, but after reading the script she realized it was 'written for me.' 'The lead was a television news reporter. She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless. 'Smart, fast-paced, and funny, the dialogue was similar to the great comedies of the 1940s. Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five, for her role as Murphy Brown, left. In the 1960s she had also modeled for Vogue as her acting career was taking off, right . 'There was something in the writing of the Murphy character that hooked me, as she eventually hooked many women. 'Is it that she was, in many ways, who we wished we could be as women? Successful in a field dominated by men? Free of the need to please? Impolitic, impolite, yet in some weird way, irresistible?' Despite the network initially trying to have the role rewritten for a younger actress such as Heather Locklear, writer-producer Diane English insisted it had to be about a 40-something woman fresh out of the Betty Ford clinic. 'The character fit me like a glove. I was instantly comfortable with the writing,' recalls Bergen. 'Diane had created a complex, original, endearing, feisty, take-no-prisoners woman. And more surprisingly, a woman who cared not a whit what others thought of her. That character gave me permission to be my brattiest, bawdiest self.' Bergen writes that the character was the first time she felt able to thrown myself into a role 'with such abandon and joy.' Bergen won acclaim early in her acting career for roles in movies such as The Adventurers, left, and has a new autobiography, A Fine Romance, out in April . After working as a fashion model and featuring on the cover of Vogue, Bergen's acting career began in the mid-60s with films such as The Sand Pebbles and The Adventurers. In 1979 she received best supporting Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Starting Over. But while her big screen roles had played on her 'glacial Nordic looks', the role of Murphy Brown allowed her to express must more range. 'What I had going for me was the element of surprise. No one ever expected me to be funny, not least because of my glacial Nordic looks and affect,' she writes. 'I'd mostly been reviled in my acting career. My Oscar nomination for Starting Over was an anomaly; basically I'd had fifteen years of bad notices by the time Murphy came along.' As well as receiving recognition for her acting talent, Bergen said the role also saw her receive recognition as a style icon. 'I wanted every outfit to be an event. And in a way, they were. Women loved what Murphy wore,' she writes. Bergen even lays claim to inventing the open-backed baseball cap. Bergen was married for 15 years to French director Louis Malle before he died of cancer in 1995 . 'When I wanted to wear a baseball cap with a high ponytail, we couldn't find one with an opening in the back, so Judy McGiveney, our wardrobe woman, made one by cutting a hole in the back,' she writes. 'A couple of months after the show aired, you could buy them in any store. Now they're standard.' Bergen writes that she enjoyed ten years of 'insane fun' playing Brown. 'Yet I never wanted it to end; doing Murphy Brown was insanely fun. When the writing was good, it was a giddy, joyous experience. I was the most comfortable and confident I'd ever been,' she writes. 'The part was a godsend—a fantastic role that completely suited me. My friends were all happy for me; it was unusual for a woman my age to get that role and that success.' Since the show ended in 1998, Bergen has appeared in movies including Miss Congeniality and Sweet Home Alabama, as well as staring in Boston Legal for five seasons. She has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including Seinfeld, Law & Order, Family Guy, Will & Grace and Sex and the City. Bergen is now married to New York real estate magnate and philanthropist Marshall Rose.",

        "input_text": "Univision host Rodner Figueroa who was fired after making a racially insensitive remark about Michelle Obama now claims that the first lady's office may have played a deciding role in his dismissal. According to Figueroa's representatives, no one from the network complained when on Wednesday he compared a makeup artist who transformed himself into Michelle Obama to a cast member of The Planet of the Apes franchise. But later that night, hours after Figueroa's entertainment news show El Gordo Y La Flacaa aired, a Univision executive reportedly contacted the TV presenter and informed him that the first lady's office had made a complaint about the remark. Scroll down for video . Bold claim: Rodner Figueroa (left) claims First Lady Michelle Obama's (right) office got him fired from Univision after he compared her to a character from Planet Of The Apes on live television . The revelation implicating the First Lady’s team in the firing, first reported by TMZ, comes after a seemingly contrite Figueroa penned an open letter to Mrs Obama apologizing for his outburst. In the missive, the sacked TV host wrote that as a bi-racial, openly gay man, he is no stranger to discrimination and has long been fighting for minorities. He also stated: 'I voted openly twice for your husband, Barack Obama.' Mrs Obama has not publicly addressed Figueroa’s claim that her staff got the Univision host fired for mocking her. Venezuelan-born Figueroa, an Emmy-Award winning host at the Spanish-language network Univision, made the Planet of the Apes remark in a segment discussing the work of make-up artist Paolo Ballesteros who posts photos of himself transformed into female celebrities. Rodner Figueroa, left, made the racially insensitive remark on the entertainment news show El Gordo Y La Flaca on Wednesday . Figueroa, 42, was talking about how Ballesteros had transformed himself into the First Lady when said: 'Well, watch out, you know that Michelle Obama looks like she's from the cast of Planet Of The Apes, the movie.' When hostess Lili Estefan countered with 'What are you saying?' and host Raul de Molina said Obama was very attractive, Figueroa defended his remark, saying 'but it is true.' The show aired live on the East Coast, but his remarks were edited out of the version broadcast for the West Coast, reports Latino Voices. Later Figueroa co-hosted the evening gossip show Sal Y Pimienta, but by Wednesday night his photo had already been removed from the network's website. In a statement on Thursday, Univision called Figueroa's comments 'completely reprehensible' and said they 'in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision.' 'Yesterday during the entertainment show El Gordo y La Flaca, Rodner Figueroa made comments about First Lady Michelle Obama that were completely reprehensible and in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision. 'As a result, Mr. Figueroa was fired immediately,' read the statement. Venezuelan-born Figueroa made the remark in a segment discussing the work of make-up artist Paolo Ballesteros who posts photos of himself transformed into female celebrities such as the First Lady . On Thursday he issued an open letter apology to Michelle Obama. In it he claimed his comments were taken out of context and that as a member of a 'bi-racial Latin family' he isn't a racist, reports Latin Times. 'I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years,' he said. 'I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino. I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that is openly gay and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities, that have been discriminated against just like me.' Figueroa had won the award for Outstanding Daytime Talent in the Spanish category at the Daytime Emmy Awards last June. Univision is the largest Spanish-language network in the United States, reaching an estimated 94 million U.S. homes. It ranks fifth among all television networks in the U.S. Figueroa, who won the Outstanding Daytime Talent in Spanish category at the Daytime Emmy Awards last June, issued an apology on Thursday . Dear First Lady Michelle Obama, . I offer my sincerest apologies for a comment that I made about the characterization from a make-up artist that I made about you in the Univision entertainment program El Gordo y La Flaca. I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and it was directed personally to you, but to the characterization of the artist, that left a lot to be desired. The clip in full context is proof. I feel embarrased, I ask for forgiveness, because there is no excuse for a professional like me to make those types of comments that can be interpreted as offensive and racist in a volatile moment that we live in our country. I take responsibility for this lack of judgement in my part, but I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years. I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino. I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that is openly gay and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities, that have been discriminated against just like me. I openly voted twice for your husband Barack Obama, because I consider him a great man that respects minorities, like me, in this country. I worked on two Univision shows where I commented about celebrity style, including the real family and Latin first ladies and I have never offended anybody because of their skin color, sexual orientation or nationality. I am a decent person, but a human in the end that makes mistakes like this one. Although the comment was unpleasant and out of line I do not deserved being called a racist and I have to defend myself for respect and love to my family, my father, my fans and my community. I was notified verbally that due to a complaint from your office I was fired. An information leak from Univision executives, I was condemend in social media, trying to destroy my career in an unfair manner, without letting me know personally and without an investigation that would allow to clear up the situation. Again, I offer my humble forgiveness for the misinterpreation and I assume the responsibility. Yours respectfully, . Rodner Figueroa .",

        "input_text": "The chief White House spokesman denied having any knowledge of the criminal charges that are reportedly being brought against New Jersey lawmaker Bob Menendez on Monday and used the lack of awareness as proof positive that the alleged investigation is a form of political payback. 'I cant speak to the accuracy of those claims,' the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said when asked about a news report claiming that federal prosecutors are  preparing to bring criminal corruption charges against the Democratic senator. And just because its been reported in the press, well, 'that's not proof of them being a fact,' he said. 'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation.' 'If there is a criminal investigation on the way, it is one that had been done wholly separate and apart from any sort of political interference,' he stated. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . CNN reported on Friday that a grand jury probe that has lasted two years was reaching a crescendo, and prosecutors, under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out, would soon bring charges against Menendez that stem from his relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. The senator has fiercely denied he has done anything illegal, and one of his conservative colleagues in the Senate, Ted Cruz, has suggested the investigation is politically motivated. Menendez told reporters on Friday, I have 'always conducted myself appropriately and in accordance with the law. 'I am not going anywhere,' he promised. Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement that 'the facts will ultimately confirm' that his behavior was in no way improper. 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. 'The timing seems awfully coincidental,' Cruz said of the probe on Saturday while speaking to reporters. 'The very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' Cruz said. Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran. Speaking to reporters on Saturday after an appearance at the Iowa Ag Summit, Cruz said the timing of the charges 'seems awfully coincidental.' COY: Asked Monday about the alleged probe, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, 'I don't know if there's a Menendez investigation' The same week Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 'came to Washington, spoke in Congress about the enormous threat of President Obama's misguided deal with Iran,' he said, and 'the very week when Bob Menendez showed incredible courage to speak out and call out President Obama for the damage that his policy was doing to our national security,' is the same week reports that he'll be charged came out. That's 'troubling,' the Texas lawmaker said. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham made a similar observation at Saturday's event, according to CNN. 'They leaked a story about an impending indictment right after the [American Israeli Public Affairs Committee] conference, right after Bob Menendez said, to his great credit, stood up and said I want to look at any deal you with Iran,' Graham charged. 'As to Bob Menendez, like every other American, he's innocent until proven otherwise. He's a friend. But this whole behavior around the Obama administration regarding the law is very disturbing.' Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Asked Monday about the alleged investigation, Earnest said, 'We don't know whether or not they're true.' 'I'm not going to comment on them for that reason.' 'The other reason I'm loathe to comment on this is that there is a principle this administration takes very seriously,' and that is 'ensuring that prosecutions are kept separate and apart from political interference or even the appearance of political interference.' 'That undermines the claims of a lot of people, including apparently Sen. Cruz,' he stated. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez’s re-election campaign. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the president's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate matter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment – principally cargo-container x-ray machines – to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing what news reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.",

        "input_text": "Death by drugs: Luke Goodman, 23, died in Colorado over the weekend after he took too many marijuana edibles and shot himself in the head . A popular college graduate died this past weekend in Colorado, after his family say he took too many marijuana candies and killed himself. Luke Goodman, 23, of Tulsa, Oklahoma ate four times the prescribed amount of a peach tart marijuana edible candy in addition to a THC-laced red velvet cookie and proceeded to shoot himself in the head with a gun he brought on the trip for protection. Goodman's family say he was a charismatic and outgoing young man who never showed signs of depression or suicidal thoughts before. They blame his death solely on the edibles. 'It was 100 per cent the drugs. It was completely because of the drugs - he had consumed so much of it,' his mother Kim Goodman told CBS Denver. Goodman was on a two-week ski trip with his family and friends when his parents dropped him off at the bus stop Saturday to go snowboarding with his cousin, Caleb Fowler. Goodman's parents were on their way back to Tulsa, and their son was going to spend the rest of the trip with his cousin. During their day out, Goodman and Fowler went to Silverthorne where the two purchased $78 worth of pot and edibles. They then went back to their lodgings and proceeded to get high. Fowler says his cousin started off by eating two peach tart candies at the same time - despite the fact that the suggested dosage is just one candy. Each candy contains 10mg of THC - the active ingredient in marijuana. When Goodman didn't immediately feel the effects of the drug, he took two more and also ate red velvet cookie baked with marijuana (his cousin had three cookies). Goodman's mother fears her son didn't read the warning label on the candies, which say the effects can take hours to kick in. Scroll down for video . Too much: Goodman's cousin Caleb Fowler says he ate five peach tart edibles, which is five times the suggested dosage. Above a stock image of a peach tart edible. It's unclear the specific brand Goodman ingested . Several hours later, Goodman's behavior changed drastically and he became jittery, incoherent and started talking nonsensically. 'He would make eye contact with us but didn’t see us, didn’t recognize our presence almost. He had never got close to this point, I had never seen him like this,' Fowler said. Apparently unaware of his serious condition, Fowler left Goodman in the condo to hop in the hot tub with other members of their vacation party. Only his cousin's mother was in the apartment, when Goodman grabbed his handgun, which he traveled with for protection, and shot himself. The single shot was fired just five minutes after Fowler left Goodman to use the hot tub. The Summit County Coroner says toxicology reports due back in a few weeks will shed more light on the edibles impact on Goodman's death. However, his family are certain that it was the edibles and edibles alone are what caused their son to take his own life. Out of character: Goodman's parents say she was a happy young man who never showed signs of depression of suicidal thoughts before the tragic incident on Saturday . 'It was completely out of character for Luke...there was no depression or anything that would leave us being concerned, nothing like that,' Mrs Goodman said. 'I was very, very close to him,' Mrs Goodman added to Daily Mail Online. 'He would share heart and soul with me.' Mrs Goodman says her son had just graduated from Oral Roberts University in December with a degree in marketing and had his whole life ahead of him. She says he had been going to the gym five or six days a week, working out for the snowboarding trip with his cousins who were some of his best friends. 'He was such a well-adjusted young man,' Mrs Goodman told us. 'He lit up people's world.' Goodman was certainly well loved, since his Facebook page was flooded with heartbroken notes from friends and family on his passing. 'Luke, your light shined so bright to everyone you came in contact with. I know your legacy will shine even brighter. You were hated by no one and loved by all. That smile and the joy you carried with you was contagious,' one friend wrote.",

The New York Post on Saturday claimed that Valerie Jarrett, a close confidant of both the president and First Lady Michelle Obama, divulged details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House. The bad press was reportedly timed to become public just as Clinton was planning to announce her candidacy for president. White House spokesman Josh Earnest indicated to reporters on Monday that the report wasn't true, though. Scroll down for video . A new report claims that it was a member of Hillary Clinton's (above) own party leaked to the press that the political heavyweight and likely presidential candidate was using a personal email address during her time as Secretary of State . Valerie Jarrett (left), one of President Barack Obama's (right) top advisers, reportedly leaked details of the story to the press through outside sources hoping it would not trace back to the White House . The story ran in the New York Post and was written by Ed Klein, who spoke last Wednesday about his belief Jarrett was involved on Fox and Friends . ‘It's utter baloney,' he said after a reporter asked him about the rumor at his regular briefing with the press. He did not comment further on the matter. According to the New York Post article, authored by Edward Klein, a source close to the White House disclosed that 'Obama and Valerie Jarrett will go to any lengths to prevent Hillary from becoming president.' 'They believe that Hillary, like her husband, is left of center, not a true-blue liberal.' Sources claim that the long rumored tension between Obama and the Clintons hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the Democrat Party refused to be seen campaigning with President Obama. Jarrett is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the Clintons, who she believed had begun 'marginalizing the president' and were 'trying to wrestle control of the Democratic Party away from Obama.' She reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge, working to get Monica Lewinsky high-profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the Clintons. Then, shortly after the midterm elections, she, the president and the first lady, reportedly sat down with Clinton and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president. This as Jarrett is reported to have been speaking to Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about possibly running in the 2016 election. 'She’s promised O’Malley and Warren the full support of the White House if they will challenge Hillary for the presidential nomination,' a source who spoke to Klein allegedly said. Jarrett has reportedly been speaking to Martin O’Malley (above), the former governor of Maryland, about running in 2016 . She has also reportedly reached out to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about entering the primary . Klein, the author of Blood Feud: The Clintons vs. the Obamas, also says he spoke to a friend of the Clintons, who told him that Bill said; 'My contacts and friends in newspapers and TV tell me that they’ve been contacted by the White House and offered all kinds of negative stories about us.' He then added; 'The Obamas are behind the e-mail story, and they’re spreading rumors that I’ve been with women, that Hillary promoted people at the State Department who’d done favors for our foundation, that John Kerry had to clean up diplomatic messes Hillary left behind.' And it's not over yet, as according to Klein, six additional probes into Clinton's performance are underway. Bill, upon learning of this, reportedly said to a friend; 'The Obamas are out to get us any way they can.' Klein seems to have known about all this for some time, having discussed it when he appeared on Fox and Friends last Wednesday. '[Bill] has said, according to my sources, that the White House is leaking to their friends in the mainstream media stories about the Clintons. Not only about Hillary, but about him, and about what she did while she was in the State Department,' Klein claimed. 'This is from sources within the White House, that the Clintons know that Hillary is under not one, but six different investigations prompted by the White House.' He then added; 'They're going through these, looking for problems on her expense account, on her dealings with foreign leaders. All of this, I'm told, is prompted by Valerie Jarrett and the president, who do not want to see Hillary Clinton become President of the United States.' Jarrett, 58, is one of President Obama’s longest serving advisers. She said in a recent interview that she would stay in the White House 'until the lights go off.'",

        "input_text": "A young woman was run over by two taxis and killed in front of her boyfriend as they walked home together following a drunken tiff. Megan Hoskins, 20, was heard to shout at soldier Mark Hughes: 'just watch... the next car that comes' before apparently laying down in the road. As Mr Hughes, also 20, tried to tend to her, a black Hackney cab ran over her, closely followed by a Skoda Octavia minicab which tried to brake but came to rest with the care assistant trapped underneath. Megan Hoskins, right, was out with boyfriend Mark Hughes, left, on the night she died on July 20, last . The inquest heard that Ms Hoskins had taken cocaine, alcohol and cannabis on the night she had died . She was rushed to hospital but died of multiple fatal injuries less than two hours later. The tragedy occurred on July 20 last year while Megan, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was spending the weekend with Mr Hughes, who was on home leave from duty in Afghanistan. An inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend's house where they drank a bottle of rosé wine each and three cans of Fosters lager. Ms Hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the Newtown Working Men's Club in Wigan. Trouble began when Mr Hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with Ms Hoskins. They left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home, where witnesses saw Ms Hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend. Mr Hughes told the Bolton hearing: 'A man had came over to dance with Megan and I said \"that's my girl, what are you doing?\" It did wind me up. I knew she wouldn't do anything but it did wind me up. We had a bit of an argument and decided to leave. Mr Hughes, right, got annoyed while out with Ms Hoskins, left, when a man approached her for a dance . A witness who overheard the row saw Ms Hughes lie down in the road, pictured, and shout 'watch now, the next car that comes' as a Fire Engine approached, which managed to avoid her but  was hit by a hackney taxi . 'We decided to walk home and were having a dispute, a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious. I was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other. At some point walking home I made a comment and she laughed. 'We were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right. I crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was. I saw her lying in the road and that's when the cars have come.' Mr Hughes said he didn't hear Ms Hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added: 'That's what I can't get out of my head. She would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she didn't have heels on. She didn't say anything. 'She would usually have a go at me if it was my fault. There was nothing.' Mr Hughes, pictured, said Ms Hoskins normally only ever fell over when out  if she was wearing high heels . Asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally, Mr Hughes replied: 'I have thought that but she wouldn't have any reason to do that. Ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend. She was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady. I had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her.' Eyewitness Amy Howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below. She said: 'I could hear them shouting. 'When they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front. She was in the road in the path of cars then shouted \"watch now, the next car that comes\". She carried on walking in the road. I could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on. I thought it was going to hit her.' Ian Dunham, the driver of the fire engine said: 'I saw a person in the road. I turned the sirens off, I didn't swerve, and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room. I knew they had had a drink so not to startle them I turned the siren off. 'I noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up I was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car's width from the pavement.' The inquest heard the driver black Hackney cab Brian Sharples could not have avoided a collision. Coroner Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing Ms Hoskins as 'caring' Joseph Parkinson the driver of the Skoda Octavia following behind him said: 'The taxi in front didn't so much swerve as rock. When the lights came on I took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road. I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't have time to swerve. If I could have done, I would have done.' The hearing was told Ms Hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people. Tests showed she had traces of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement. Mr Hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of Ms Hoskins' manslaughter but no action was taken against him. Recording an open conclusion, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'She was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent, bright and spent her life caring for others. In Miss Howarth's opinion, she believes Megan was deliberately standing in front of cars. We have heard from Mark that that didn't happen. 'I don't know how or why she was in the road. It could have been that she fell, although she would normally fall if wearing heels. It could have been that she collapsed. It could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road. 'Sadly for unknown reasons to me, through collapse or choice, Megan was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles. The difficulty I have is I don't know why she was on the floor. The only person who can tell me why she was on the floor is Megan and sadly she is not here to tell me that.'",

The mother was horrified after she and her baby were left stranded at Gold Coast Airport after their plane turned around on the runway, delivering her to federal and local police who had been alerted by the airline. Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out to the runway on Gold Coast airport. Scroll down for video . Virginie Rutgers was forced off a flight with her son after she refused to stop breastfeeding during take-off . Virgin Australia are being questioned on social media for their decision to turn their plane around to take a woman and her baby back to the terminal, where she was questioned by police . Virginie Rutgers started to feed her 10-month-old son to soothe him while their plane taxied out from Gold Coast airport . She used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy, but was told to remove it by Virgin Australia staff. ‘He (the flight attendant) started to raise his voice and become quite abusive,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News. A woman who alleges she witnessed the incident from a couple of seats away has come forward, describing the ‘shocking’ incident on the Virgin Australia Facebook page. Laureen Fairweather insists the mother and child were sitting in separate seats, with the infant using the appropriate regulation seatbelt while he was being fed. ‘The child was not restrained with the carrier at all! They both had their seat belts on. She was covering herself with the carrier while nursing.’ Ms Fairweather wrote. Virginie used a baby sling to cover herself and the child for privacy whilst they were reportedly both buckled in different seats, but she was told to remove the blanket by Virgin Australia staff . The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff . ‘She showed (the staff) too but they insisted it had to go.’ Ms Fairweather was shaken by the staff’s conduct during the confrontation. ‘Having witnessed the whole event, I can honestly guarantee you that it was not a pretty scene.’ ‘(Ms Rutgers) did comply with the rule by restraining herself and the child.’ ‘Absolutely gobsmacked at how rude and offensive the staffs were - totally unprofessional (Sic),’ she wrote. The mother claims staff did not explain why covering her child’s head with a sling was a hazard. Ms Rutgers continued feeding her child and was subsequently forced off the plane. ‘I was in a state of shock honestly. He (her son) was screaming because I couldn’t feed him any more,’ Ms Rutgers told Seven News. Ms Rutgers continued feeding her child and was subsequently forced off the plane. She was 'shocked' and her son was screaming when she was unable to finish his feed . Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast airport . The pilot turned the plane back to the terminal where Ms Rutgers was met by local and federal police, who had reportedly been summoned by Virgin Australia staff. Ms Rutgers was allowed to go without charge, but found herself stranded with her baby at Gold Coast Airport. Virgin Australia has refused to compensate her for the cost of her hotel that evening or for her taxis. But the airlines denies allegations of discrimination against the mother and said her breastfeeding had nothing to do with decision to remove her from the flight, according to Seven News. 'Our crew acted in accordance with Civil Aviation Safety Authority regulations and, most importantly, with your child's safety at the forefront of their actions,' Virgin said. People aware of Ms Rutger’s experience have taken to Virgin Australia’s Facebook page. ‘Utterly pathetic sevice virgin! I fly frequently and will make sure i NEVER fly with you again. I do not want to get kicked off a plan for breastfeeding my child,’ wrote one former customer. ‘Breast feeding is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child,' a supporter wrote on the Virgin Australia Facebook page . ‘(Breast feeding) is actually really good for the child and surrounding passengers ears and sanity, as it will help settle the child. Never ever will I fly virgin,’ another declared. Representatives from the airline have responded to accusations regarding the case. ‘We can assure you that Virgin Australia welcomes breastfeeding on board our aircraft, as outlined in our policy,’ they replied to a Facebook post regarding the incident. ‘The safety of our guests is always our number one priority and there are a number of CASA regulations that must be followed on board to safeguard this, including ones that apply specifically to infants.’ ‘For privacy reasons, we cannot comment publicly on specific cases.’ We can assure you that Virgin Australia welcomes breastfeeding on board our aircrafts, as outlined in our policy,’ Virgin Australia said . Ms Rutger has vowed to never fly with Virgin again. She and her baby took a Qantas flight the following day . However other people on Facebook have sided with Virgin Australia, pointing out their responsibility to adhere to strict safety protocols. ‘I think anyone with any sense would realize the issue here. Safety comes first. Breastfeeding is a right all mothers should have, but that right shouldn't take precedence over safety,’ argued one person. ‘I am sure that the staff had their reasons for asking her to remove the carrier, it may have been a projectile or strangulation risk in the event of a difficult take off,’ wrote another. ‘I wasn't there so I can't comment on how it was handled but I do think you have to trust the staff when it comes to safety requirements and requests.’ Virgin Australia have offered Ms Rutger flight credit to make up for the additional costs she accrued when she was kicked off her flight. However, Ms Rutger has vowed to never fly with Virgin again. She and her baby took a Qantas flight the following day.",

And if hackers tried to obtain copies of her  communications, they couldn't have, Clinton said, because she had 'numerous safeguards' in place to protect her home-brewed server. 'It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,' Clinton said at a press conference. Security experts remain doubtful, however, that Clinton's emails contained only unclassified information and warn that her email or server could have been hacked without her knowledge - possibly exposing sensitive communications between the former secretary of state and the president. Scroll down for video . If hackers tried to obtain copies of her sensitive, State Department communications, they couldn't have, Hillary Clinton told reporters Tuesday, because she had 'numerous safeguards' in place to protect her home-brewed server . 'To say it wasn’t compromised is to say, \"I don’t know it was compromised,\" ' Stewart Baker, an assistant secretary at the the Department of Homeland Security during George W. Bush's presidency told Politico. 'It would be pretty easy for a nation-state to compromise that account, and pretty easy to hide the fact that they had compromised that account,' he said. The White House acknowledged on Monday that Clinton and Obama did email each other from time to time. 'I would not describe the number of emails as large, but they did have the occasion to email each other,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. The National Security Agency technician who was in charge of the team that built President Barack Obama’s specialized Blackberry, Dickie George, said it's unlikely the president ever said anything to Clinton over email that could be seen as damaging if exposed. 'He’s actually very security conscious … There’s no, absolutely no, chance that he put anything sensitive in those emails, ' George told Politico. Still, Bruce Brody, a former chief information security officer at the Department of Energy who is now oversee secuirty at Cubic Global Defense, cautioned that even the most innocent of conversations between Clinton and Obama could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands. 'There’s more intelligence in casual conversation than you might think, just because he’s the president of the damned United States,' Baker told the publication. A Q and A document sent to reporters by Clinton's staff after the former State Department official's Tuesday afternoon briefing with the press asserted that 'robust protections were put in place' by the secretary and updated as needed. Yet it did not say what those were, citing concerns that 'people with ill-intentions' would attempt to break into her security system, which Clinton says was set up her husband, Bill, a former president, and guards the private communications of both him and his aides. The nine-page document disclosed, however, that  third-party experts were consulted. It did not name names. Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union told Politico that unless Clinton 'was paying a team of people to keep her personal email secure, it’s likely it was less secure,' however. The State Department, he pointed out, has a full-time security team and the National Security Administration at its disposal. 'It was on property guarded by the Secret Service, and there were no security breaches,' Clinton said at a press conference . South Carolina Republican Rep.Trey Gowdy, head of the task force that' s investigating the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack to determine what knowledge the State Department possessed - if any - that could have prevented the assault, said Tuesday afternoon that Clinton should be required to turn over the server for inspection. She also needs to answer lingering, 'serious questions 'about the security of the system she employed,' he said in a statement, and 'who had access to the server from the time Secretary Clinton left office until the time – almost two years later – the State Department asked for these public records back.' Gowdy also wants access to the server to determine if any of the more than 30,000 personal emails Clinton says she got rid of because they were not related to her work at the State Department can be retrieved. Clinton says gave the State Department copies of all her work-related emails, yet 'without access to Secretary Clinton's personal server, there is no way for the State Department to know it has acquired all documents that should be made public,' Gowdy said. The former Obama administration official said Tuesday the server will remain out of the government's grasp, however. 'No one wants their personal email made public, and I think most people understand that and respect that privacy,' she told reporters while explaining her decision to toss emails she didn't think were pertinent to national security. Should Clinton change her mind and give the government unfettered access to her private property Chester Wisniewski, senior security adviser at Canadian computer company Sophos, says its possible that anything she tried to destroy may still be on the server. 'If the emails were on a server in her house and she deleted them, there’s a chance the emails could still be on the server’s hard drive if you forensically examine it,' he told the New York Times. 'To make sure the emails are really destroyed, you would have to physically destroy the hard drive, which many companies and places like the Defense Department often do.' Reporters flooded the United Nation's headquarters on Tuesday to listen to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton answer questions about her use of a private email system while serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet. A Q and A document sent to reporters after the briefing asserted that 'robust protections were put in place' by Clinton and updated as needed . Another concern of government officials is that Clinton deliberated classified information via her personal email address, which is against the law. She says she didn't. 'Classified information was viewed in hard copy by the secretary while in the office,' the statement from her office distributed on Tuesday said. But a former senior State Department official who worked in the diplomatic core of the government before her told the New York Times that Clinton's claim is dubious. 'I would assume that more than 50 percent of what the secretary of state dealt with was classified,' he said. 'Was every single email of the secretary of state completely unclassified? Maybe, but it’s hard to imagine.' Even if Clinton did confer with her colleagues about classified topics over email, 'there’s zero chance that she’ll be charged with unauthorized retention of classified information, because she decides what’s classified,' Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists, told the Times. The secretary of state, he said, has the highest classification authority at the department and the power to dictate what is and isn't restricted.",

        "input_text": "The National Collegiate Athletics Association is worried about holding the Final Four – one of the nation's biggest college sporting events – in Indianapolis, after Indiana's governor signed a 'religious freedom' bill into law that gay rights activists say is a license to discriminate. Mark Emmert, the president of the NCAA, said Thursday that the governing body for college sports is 'especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.' The Final Four, an annual culmination of the national men's college basketball tournament, is slated to be held next week at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, a city where the NCAA itself is based. The new statute, the first of its kind passed this year, invalidates state and local laws that 'substantially burden' the ability of people – including businesses and associations – to follow their religious beliefs . Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, supported the bill as it moved through the state legislature and was passed by wide margins in both chambers. He signed it in a private ceremony Thursday morning. Pence is considering whether to enter the 2016 presidential race, but is considered an outsider with long odds at success. STUMBLE? Future FInal Four appearances in Indianapolis could be in jeopardy because of a new religious-freedom law that Indiana gay rights activists saw is a license to discriminate . CALM DOWN! Indiana Gov. Mike Pence addressed the new statute in a news conference at the Statehouse in Indianapolis on Thursday . NO MEANS NO? Indiana's staet government won't be able to force bakeries run by evangelical Christians to provide wedding cakes for same-sex couples under the new law . There's no indication the NCAA has any plans to relocate the Final Four this year – ticketing and promotions have been underway for more than six months – but the event is scheduled to return to Indianapolis in 2021 and the NCAA is hinting that it might bolt the Hoosier State. 'We will work diligently to assure student-athletes competing in, and visitors attending, next week's Men's Final Four in Indianapolis are not impacted negatively by this bill,' Emmert said. 'Moving forward, we intend to closely examine the implications of this bill and how it might affect future events as well as our workforce.' An online push for the NCAA to react to the bill began earlier this week, carrying the hashtag #Final4Fairness. Former professional basketball player Jason Collins, the first openly gay athlete to play in the NBA, tweeted: '@GovPenceIN, is it going to be legal for someone to discriminate against me & others when we come to the #FinalFour?' A pressure group called the LGBT Sports Coalition asked Thursday for the NCAA, the Big Ten, the NFL, USA Diving and USA Gymnastics to pull their events from Indianapolis over the next 16 months. The Big Ten holds its football championship game in at Lucas Oil Field and has a contract to remain there until 2021. The conference also is scheduled to hold its men's basketball tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis in 2020 and 2022. The Big Ten women's basketball tournament is set to be held in Indianapolis for six years beginning in 2017. The NFL also holds its draft combine at Lucas Oil Stadium every year. Indiana's largest city is also hoping to land the 2019 Super Bowl. Pence said in a statement Thursday that the new law, patterned after a federal law signed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, ensures 'religious liberty is fully protected.' 'The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion, but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action,' he said. Reaction to the decision was swift and divided. Indiana Right to Life President and CEO Mike Fichter praised the new law, saying it would give abortion opponents legal recourse if they are pressured to support the procedure. The organization circulated an online petition to thank Pence for signing the bill. FINAL FORGET-IT: Look for gay-rights protests next week when the Final Four comes to Indiana's largest sports arena, Lucas Oil Stadium . MIXED REACTIONS: A window sign on a downtown Indianapolis florist shows its owner's objection to the Religious Freedom bill passed by the Indiana legislature . Freedom Indiana, the gay rights group that led a successful 2014 fight against efforts to add a gay marriage ban to the state constitution, called it 'a sad day for Indiana,' saying Pence and lawmakers ignored concerns of thousands of Indiana residents. 'We made it clear that this law will only be used to harm other Hoosiers, and that's not the Indiana way. The lawmakers didn't listen. The governor didn't listen,' the group said in a statement. ON DECK: Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson says he'll sing a similar law if his state's legislature passes it . At least two groups – the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and Gen Con – have said they would reconsider plans to hold their conventions in Indianapolis because of the legislation. Gen Con is a videogaming convention that drew 56,000 people – most of them young – last year, making it the city's largest convention in both economic impact and attendance numbers. The CEO of the California technology company Salesforce told the Indianapolis Business Journal his company would reduce its investment in the state, specifically because of the new law. Supporters say discrimination concerns are overblown and that the Indiana measure merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide services like catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. They note that similar laws are already on the books in 19 states. Last year, Mississippi enacted its own religious freedom law just weeks after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, vetoed a similar effort there amid criticism from large corporations concerned about its impact on doing buiness in the state. 'This bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it,' Pence said Thursday. 'For more than 20 years, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act has never undermined our nation's anti-discrimination laws, and it will not in Indiana.' Chad Griffin, national president of the Human Rights Campaign, held his own press conference with one anchored by Hutchinson, the Arkansas governor . COUNFOUNDING EXPECTATIONS: Republican Jan Brewer, then Arizona's governor, vetoed a similar bill in 2014 before leaving office . The nation's political climate is vastly different from what President Clinton saw in 1993, however: The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this year on whether gay marriage bans violate the U.S. Constitution. The Indianapolis chamber of commerce opposed the bill on the grounds that it could make it more difficult to attract top companies and employees. Similar bills have been advancing this year in the Arkansas and Georgia legislatures. Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Thursday that if his state's lawmakers send the bill to his desk, he'll sign it into law. 'I think it's a bill that puts a high priority on religious freedom and recognizes that as a part of the balance,' Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference after Pence signed his state's bill. Elsewhere at the state Capitol in Little Rock, Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin told journalists that the legislative push 'is a concerted effort by a hateful political faction to say that Arkansas does not welcome all its citizens, sending a clear message that this state is not open for business – and all this is happening on Gov. Hutchinson's watch. Griffin's organization is America's wealthiest and most powerful gay rights group. The latest changes to the Arkansas bill, tweaked on Wednesday night, give liberal lobbyists some ground by agreeing that complying with federal law counts as a 'compelling government intetest.' But Griffin said Thursday that his group wasn't satisfied. 'You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig,' he said. Indiana GOvernor Mike Pence . Pence delivered a brief statement during a news conference on Thursday, after signing the controversial bill into law: . 'Today I signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, because I support the freedom of religion for every Hoosier of every faith. 'The Constitution of the United States and the Indiana Constitution both provide strong recognition of the freedom of religion but today, many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action. 'One need look no further than the recent litigation concerning the Affordable Care Act. A private business and our own University of Notre Dame had to file lawsuits challenging provisions that required them to offer insurance coverage in violation of their religious views. 'Fortunately, in the 1990s Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—limiting government action that would infringe upon religion to only those that did not substantially burden free exercise of religion absent a compelling state interest and in the least restrictive means. 'Last year the Supreme Court of the United States upheld religious liberty in the Hobby Lobby case based on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, but that act does not apply to individual states or local government action. At present, nineteen states—including our neighbors in Illinois and Kentucky—have adopted Religious Freedom Restoration statutes. And in eleven additional states, the courts have interpreted their constitutions to provide a heightened standard for reviewing government action. 'In order to ensure that religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law, this year our General Assembly joined those 30 states and the federal government to enshrine these principles in Indiana law, and I fully support that action. 'This bill is not about discrimination, and if I thought it legalized discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it. In fact, it does not even apply to disputes between private parties unless government action is involved. For more than twenty years, the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act has never undermined our nation's anti-discrimination laws, and it will not in Indiana. 'Indiana is rightly celebrated for the hospitality, generosity, tolerance, and values of our people, and that will never change. Faith and religion are important values to millions of Hoosiers and with the passage of this legislation, we ensure that Indiana will continue to be a place where we respect freedom of religion and make certain that government action will always be subject to the highest level of scrutiny that respects the religious beliefs of every Hoosier of every faith.'",
        "summary": "Look for gay rights protests at Lucas Oil Stadium as the men's college basketball tournament comes to Indianapolis, where the NCAA is based .\nLaw signed Thursday trumps state and local statutes that force business owners to serve the public in ways that violate their religious beliefs .\nGay rights groups see the measure – the 20th of its kind in America – as a back-door license to discriminate .\nRepublican Gov. Mike Pence signed it while insisting that it brings Indiana in line with a 1993 federal religious-protection law signed by Bill Clinton .\nPence is a long-shot but still in the hunt as a potential 2016 Republican presidential nominee ."

Nathan Thompson allegedly loaded 11 bull terriers cross puppies into his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri on Wednesday, according to the Daily Telegraph. As a result of his plea, Thompson cannot own, acquire, buy or possess any animal, or even be around another animal without an adult present, for a decade. Scroll down for video . Nathan Thompson, 25, allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Only one of the animals survived (pictured) Thompson (pictured) leaves East Maitland Court after pleading guilty to animal abuse . Magistrate Caleb Franklin granted Thompson bail to be sentenced on April 28. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Thompson made comments at his home after being released on bail saying he knew he looked 'cold blooded' but he believed he was helping out a friend. 'People are looking at me like I'm a cold-blooded killer because of what I have done and I can understand that,' he said. But he 'loved his dog' and was shattered that she was confiscated. The  25-year-old allegedly loaded 11 Bull Terriers in his car and took them to bushland at McLeods Road, Kurri Kurri - north of Sydney - on Wednesday afternoon. Police say an advertisement on Gumtree was placed online last Thursday for the sale of 11 Bull Terrier cross puppies. Almost a week later, it is alleged the owner had not sold the dogs and offered the puppies free of charge to the 25-year-old who accepted. It's alleged that a witness saw the 25-year-old man begin to kill a number of the puppies, aged six to eight weeks, by hitting them over the head with a rock, then throwing them into the bush. The witness confronted the man, who drove from the area with five of the dogs still alive. The RSPCA were contacted and attended the location, before taking the attacked puppies to a vet. Only one of the animals, named Lucky, survived. David O'Shannessy, RSPCA NSW's chief inspector, told Daily Mail Australia he was shocked by the incident. 'We deal with a lot of cases but in this particular incident someone has allegedly gone out of their way to do something to the dogs which makes it even more concerning for us,' he said. 'This sort of situation doesn't have to occur.' Mr O'Shannessy says by the time the RSPCA arrived at the scene only two dogs were alive. Nathan Thompson, the man accused of horrifically murdering 10 puppies,  pleaded guilty to four counts of animal cruelty . 'There were seven pups in total when we arrived and five of them were deceased,' he said. 'Most of them had significant head injuries so you can image what the scene was like when we got there. 'The inspectors quickly transported the surviving dogs to the clinic but one of them died on the way.' Police and RSPCA arrested the 25-year-old at a house in Kurri Kurri on Thursday. Police say the man allegedly told them four of the five remaining puppies were destroyed and the fifth was re-homed. 'Something's not quite right with the numbers so we've made some inquiries about the other dogs,' Mr O'Shannessy said. Lucky, the surviving dog, is in the care of the RSCPA and is stable, however Mr O'Shannessy says he has 'grave concerns' for her. 'She appeared to have some injuries and had blood shot eyes when we rescued her,' he said. 'But who knows what Lucky's witnessed.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

        "input_text": "A woman who spent 22 years on death row in her son's killing tearfully described on Tuesday how she suffered twin tragedies in losing her young child and being the victim of a 'blatant miscarriage of justice.' Debra Milke spoke out at a news conference in Phoenix, Arizona a day after her case was dismissed in the 1989 killing of her 4-year-old son, who thought he was going to see Santa Claus when he was taken to the desert and shot in the back of the head. Her conviction was overturned by an appeals court that ruled her murder conviction was tainted because of the work of a discredited detective. Scroll down for video . In tears: Debra Milke cries during a news conference in Phoenix, Arizona, on March 24, 2015 as she speaks of the tragedy of losing her child and of being falsely accused of his murder . Debra Milke (pictured in a prison mug shot) denied that she ever confessed to killing her son Christopher (right) who was wearing his favorite outfit when he was murdered by two of her friends . Milke sobbed repeatedly as she read a statement about her ordeal, fondly recalling her son's love of bubble gum and riding his big wheel. 'Losing a child to murder is a devastating tragedy with an indescribable pain no parent should ever have to feel. It is the purest form of anguish imaginable that sears the soul, and the hurt never goes away, ever,' she said. 'The only thing worse is to be falsely accused of participating in your own child's death.' Milke was convicted of murder and sentenced to death based almost entirely on an unrecorded confession authorities say she made to Detective Armando Saldate. Her lawyers  called him a 'dirty cop' with a long history of misconduct. 'She's an innocent woman who never should have been convicted. She was the victim of a dirty cop,' defense lawyer Michael Kimerer said. Debra Milke said in a news conference on Tuesday that losing a child to murder is the 'purest form of anguish imaginable that sears the soul, and the hurt never goes away, ever' Debra Milke looks on in tears during a news conference as she speaks of her painful time on death row for the alleged killing of her 4-year old son and who  was freed this week after her murder case was dismissed . Milke was convicted of plotting with two friends to kill her son Christopher, who was led into the desert and shot three times in the back of the head . Prosecutors insist that Milke had her son killed, but they lost their final appeal last week to have her retried in her son's death. Authorities say Milke's motive was that she didn't want the child anymore and didn't want him to live with his father. James Styers and Roger Scott, the two men who led Christopher to his death, have refused to testify against Milke. While Milke sat on death row, the Arizona Supreme Court had gone so far as to issue a death warrant for her in 1997. The execution was delayed because she had yet to exhaust federal appeals. Multiple rulings in other cases said the now-retired officer either lied under oath or violated suspects' rights during interrogations, according to the federal appeals court. Milke sued the city of Phoenix, Maricopa County and numerous individuals earlier this month, alleging authorities violated her civil rights. She also contends she was denied a fair trial and was a victim of malicious prosecution. James Styers and Roger Scott are on death row for the horrific murder of Christopher. They have both denied that Milke had anything to do with the killing . Milke, whose mother was a German who married a U.S. Air Force military policeman in Berlin in the 1960s, has drawn strong support from citizens of that nation and Switzerland, neither of which has the death penalty. All charges against Debra Jean Milke were dismissed on  Monday -  25 years after she was convicted and sentenced to die for the brutal murder of her four-year-old son. Milke was released from jail in 2013 after 22 years on Arizona's death row, but still faced the possibility of a retrial and remained free on bail with an electronic monitoring bracelet. Dirty cop: Detective Armando Saldate claimed that Milke confessed to him - but never recorded the confession. His testimony sent her to death row. It was later discredited . On Monday, Maricopa County Superior Court before Judge Rosa Mroz found that there was not enough evidence to take the case against Milke to trial. She ordered the charges dismissed with prejudice - meaning she cannot be re-tried. The judge also ordered probation officers to remove her electronic monitoring bracelet and close out Milke's case. The hearing took just two minutes, according to KSAZ-TV. Milke, 51, hugged her lawyer and her supporters and sobbed as she left the courtroom on Monday. Milke's conviction was based almost entirely on Phoenix police Detective Armando Saldate's claims that she had confessed to him that she plotted to killed her son Christopher. Debra Milke, pictured on Monday in court, had murder charges against her dismissed - 25 years after she was convicted and sentenced to die . Milke leaned in for a hug with her attorney Lori Voepel (right) on Monday after she was finally cleared of all charges in the murder of her son . The confession was never recorded and it was later revealed that Saldate had a history of lying under oath and violating the rights of suspects. In December 1989, Milke dressed her son in his favorite outfit and sent him off to the mall to see Santa Claus in the care of her roommate, James Styers. Styers later picked up Roger Scott and the two men drove Christopher into the desert and shot him three times in the back of the head. Prosecutors argued that Milke no longer wanted Christopher, but hated his father so much that she didn't want to give up custody of the boy. At the time of his arrest, Scott claimed that Milke had discussed splitting the boy's $50,000 life insurance policy with him - but later recanted that statement. Styers and Scott were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder. The refused to testify against Milke and now maintain she had nothing to do with the little boy's death. Both men are awaiting execution. In 2013, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction and sentence of death, finding that the . Judge Mroz, when she ordered Milke's release, said allegations of Saldate's past misconduct 'cast serious doubts on the validity of the Defendant’s alleged confession.' Saldate, who has since retired from the police force, said previously that he would not testify at a retrial of Milke. Prosecutors had tried to force Saldate to testify at the re-trial and set a new trial date for her, but the Arizona Supreme Court rejected the request. Milke has filed a lawsuit against Phoenix, Maricopa County and several officials and investigators involved in her conviction. She says she was the victim of malicious prosecution.",

        "input_text": "A Washington D.C. tech entrepreneur has recalled his anger at learning his former Playmate wife had died in a hot tub after a night of sex, cocaine and drinking with her lover. Gary Hensley, 37, detailed the heart-wrenching moment he found out his wife Cassandra had died and the challenges he has faced as a single father to her two children from a previous relationship. 'I'll always miss her,' Hensley told the Washington Post. Cassandra Lynn Hensley, who was named a Playboy Playmate of the Month in 2006, had flown from the couple's home to Los Angeles to attend Playboy's 60th anniversary party in January 2014. Family: Gary Hensley is widowed and a single dad to his step-children, Alexis and Devin, pictured, following the death of his wife, former Playboy Playmate Cassandra Lynn, in January 2014 . But after taking part in a photo shoot, the 34-year-old headed to a photographer's apartment, had sex with him and  binged on drugs and alcohol, TMZ previously reported. In the early hours of the next morning, the photographer woke up and found Cassandra unconscious in the bathtub. Emergency responders were unable to resuscitate her and she was pronounced dead. Gary Hensley, who met Cassandra when they were neighbors in 2007, was home with her two children, Alexis and Devin, then 12 and six, when an acquaintance messaged him asking: 'Is it true?' Moments later, two police officers turned up on his doorstep and explained that his wife had been found dead in Los Angeles - although they would not reveal the circumstances. 'I just had this overwhelming sense of wanting to be next to her,' he told the Washington Post's Ellen McCarthy. Questions: Hensley is pictured with his wife, who was found dead in a hot tub after a night of sex, drugs and alcohol with her lover in Los Angeles. He said he is still haunted by questions of how much she loved him . Playmate: Cassandra, pictured with Hugh Hefner, had been named a Playmate of the Month in 2006 . But after calling the coroner, he learned the lurid details of her death. He said his reaction was anger - because he didn't know how he was going to raise the children without her. 'I was so angry at her,' he said. 'I was like, \"What am I going to do? How am I going to raise the kids? How do I get Alexis through prom and her wedding and all those things you're not going to be there for?\"' Today Hensley, who has since learned that the affair had been going on for a while, is still haunted by questions of how much his wife loved him. 'A year past all that, I just have come to the resolve that for the five years we were together, she did - to the degree that she could,' he told the Post. 'And nobody's perfect. Neither am I.' He knew Cassandra had struggled with drugs and alcohol when she was younger and, in the months before her death, he noticed that she had started drinking again. Hensley, who launched a tech start-up that was later acquired by Pearson Education, said his job's uncertainty, problems in her own career and their move to Washington D.C., where Cassandra was judged for her past, had been tough on her. Struggles: He said that before her death, Cassandra (pictured in 2007) had struggled with problems in her career and in their new life in Washington D.C., where she was not accepted because of her past . Cassandra, who worked as an event hostess before her death, started drinking again, including the night before she flew to California. They didn't talk that night, Hensley said, but she texted him after heading to the airport to say that she loved him. After her death, he eventually returned to their home with the children, whom he had been raising as his own. Their biological father had not wanted custody, the Post reported. 'It was a very quiet, very lonely, very clean house,' he said. 'Nights were particularly hard.' He took time from work and tried to bring some normalcy to the children's lives, figuring out how to talk to them about the tragedy, and getting through the days with the help of family and friends. He said they've now 'got it down' and the children both call him 'Dad'. 'It always makes me smile,' he said.",

Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas was sentenced  to life in prison without parole on Thursday at Young County Court. Armandariz killed his two sons, Gatlin, two, and Luke, who was just eight-months-old in April 2011 before sending  a string of chilling text messages to their mother, Lauren Smith. One of the messages included a graphic image that appeared to show Luke dead, dangling from the closet held by cloth attached to his neck. While he will not be put to death, defense attorneys insist he will have a miserable life in prison. Scroll down for video . Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas was sentenced on Thursday to life in prison without parole in the capital murder case (above Armandariz pictured in court on March 12 during his sentencing at the Young County Courthouse in Graham, Texas) Prosecutor Lisa Tanners said the state had to allow the citizens to decide if Armandariz should pay with his life or not (above Armandariz as Young County Judge Stephen Bristow read the jury's decision) He was convicted of the murders on February 27 which was followed by four weeks of testimony that the court heard before deciding his fate. However, the jury decided to spare him his life after stating there were mitigating circumstances to not execute him . Armandariz strangled his two sons, Gatlin (right), two, and Luke (left), eight months, in April 2011. Police found their bodies hidden in a crawl space underneath his home . Armandariz was convicted of the murders on February 27 which was followed by four weeks of testimony that the court heard before deciding his fate, according to the Graham Leader. The jury decided to spare him his life after stating there were mitigating circumstances to not execute him. The father was deemed too dangerous to society to live by prosecutors from the attorney general's office, according to the Star-Telegram. Earlier in the trial, prosecutor Tom Cloudt said: 'Gabriel is a lying, manipulating baby killer, and the evidence has shown this. 'Luke is dead, and Gabriel is trying to get a beer. Gabriel is not concerned.' Armandariz was cited as too dangerous to society to live by prosecutors from the Texas attorney general's office including, Tom Cloudt, who said the father is not phased by the killings . The father sent a string of chilling text messages to the children's mother, Lauren Smith, which included a graphic image that appeared to show Luke dead, dangling from the closet held by cloth attached to his neck (above Armandariz, left, pictured with Smith, right and their two sons) Armandariz called police after killing the boys telling them he had done it because Smith had told him to before ending the two-minute call (above Armandariz pictured with his sons) Last month, the text messages Armandariz sent to Smith where he said he was planning to kill the boys were revealed in court. Armandariz said he was doing it because of her partying ways while possibly pretending to be his new girlfriend. In one of the messages Armandariz sent to his ex, just hours before the boys are believe to have died, he wrote: 'I commend the spirits of these two boys to the Lord. I would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends.' This was quickly followed by another in which he wrote: 'Look, I’m trying to offer you another opportunity to see our children. But as usual you would much rather be with your friends.' According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, prosecutors in the case argued that Smith was not even aware the texts were coming from Armandariz, and actually believed they were coming from the woman he was dating at the time. This seems to be backed up by the her responses to these texts, as she wrote in one: 'If I were you I’d get the hell away from him. Looks can be deceiving.' On the day the boys died, Armandariz sent a photo to Smith that appeared to show Luke dead. This was followed by the final text, which also showed both boys alive and lying next to him, and read: 'We love u, goodbye.' The final message Armandariz sent Smith, which included an image of both boys alive and lying next to him, read: 'We love u, goodbye' In February, Lt. James Reeves (above) revealed that after seeing the picture of Luke hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin. Following the sentencing on Thursday, Lt. Reeves said justice has been serviced and that reliving the case was 'tough on everybody' Armandariz will be transferred to the Texas Department of Corrections to serve his sentence (pictured above leaving court) Once she received the graphic image of her dead son, she called authorities, according to Everything Lubbock. However, Armandariz had already called police telling them he had killed the boys because Smith had told him to before ending the two-minute call. In the bizarre 911 call he told the operator; 'My girlfriend asked me to kill my babies. What was I supposed to do? My girlfriend told me to kill both of them. What was I supposed to do? I hate her, I hate her, I hate her so much. I’m so scared now.' In February, Lt. James Reeves revealed that after seeing the picture of Luke hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin. 'We were operating on the belief that Luke was dead,' said Lt. Reeves. 'We didn’t know about the older son.' However, when officers arrived, they found he bodies inside a tarp found in a crawl space underneath the residence Armandariz shared with his relatives in Graham. Officers went to Armandriz's home after being alerted about the graphic message sent with image of Luke's dead body. When they arrived, they found both bodies inside a tarp found in a crawl space underneath the residence Armandariz shared with his relatives in Graham . 'We saw four little feet inside the tarp,' said Lt. Reeves. 'One of the feet had a shoe on it. It was a little camel tennis shoe and that’s how we knew. We never laid eyes on the bodies other than to see those feet.' Following the sentencing on Thursday, Lt. Reeves said justice has been serviced and that reliving the case was 'tough on everybody', according to Texomas Homepage. While defense lawyers are happy that Armandariz was allowed to live, he will have a 'very miserable life' in prison, said  attorney Terri Moore. 'We have never tried to excuse what Gabriel did,' said Moore. 'What he did was completely wrong and was a criminal act but he’s got life without any possibility of parole and that is a severe punishment. 'It is a harsh punishment. He will have a very miserable life.' Moore added that capital punishment is for the 'worst of the worst human being' and the crime Gabriel committed was horrible, but that he is 'not the worst of the worst human being'. Armandariz will be transferred to the Texas Department of Corrections to serve his sentence.",

It took the jury just under three hours to find Daniel Jack Kelsall guilty of indecently assaulting the 31-year-old and murdering him in the early hours of September 8, 2013. Mr Huxley's family and friends let out exclamations when the verdict was handed down. Speaking outside court on Wednesday Mr Huxley's ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall said his 'life had been stolen by a worthless psychopath'. Kelsall remained expressionless in the dock as his mother Lynne and father Mark, who had sat near him throughout the trial, looked on. Scroll down for video . The man accused of stabbing Sydney man Morgan Huxley more than 20 times has been found guilty of his murder . Morgan Huxley (pictured) was fatally stabbed on September 8, 2013 at his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore . Mr Huxley's family and friends let out exclamations when the verdict was handed down . Deirdree Huxley (right), the mother of Morgan Huxley, and ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall, depart the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney on Wednesday . In a statement on behalf of Huxley's family, Ms Hall said her former boyfriend was 'an inspiring, generous and loving young man'. 'Morgan was beginning to make his way in the world,' she said outside court. 'He had hopes and dreams that he will never be able to realise. 'He will never get married and never be able to run around a park with his children. We love you Morgan.' It has also emerged that the killer stalked two other men in Neutral Bay, one just a week after he murdered Mr Huxley in his bedroom. One young man told police that just a week after the murder and just streets away, a man he identified as Kelsall — and wearing the same cook’s uniform — stalked him down Ben Boyd Rd almost to his front door. The young man said he confronted Kelsall, who ran off, according to the Daily Telegraph. Another man also told police he was having a cigarette outside a block of units in Spruson St several months before the murder when a man, who he later identified as Kelsall, jumped out from behind a bush. The ex-girlfriend of Morgan Huxley prepares to read a statement at the court . Deirdree Huxley (right), the mother of Morgan Huxley, and ex-girlfriend Jessica Hall (second left), depart with friends at the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney . Owen Huxley, the brother of Morgan Huxley, leaves the NSW Supreme Court in Sydney on Wednesday . Over the course of two week trial, the jury in the NSW Supreme Court heard how Mr Huxley had been discovered by his flatmate lying in a pool of blood in the doorway of his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. The crown relied on a string of circumstantial evidence, which crown prosecutor Peter McGrath SC told the jury would leave them to infer only one thing - Kelsall was the killer. The first was CCTV footage which shows an intoxicated and barefoot Mr Huxley leaving the nearby Oaks Hotel around 1.30am with Kelsall breaking into a jog behind him. Kelsall tracked him into his home, indecently assaulted him as he lay on his bed, and then stabbed him at least 20 times, the crown said. His DNA had been found on Mr Huxley's penis and a single print matching his ring finger was on the businessman's bedroom door. Mr Huxley's blood was also found on the shoulder bag Kelsall was carrying that night - which the 22-year-old had tried to clean in an 'amateurish' attempt. But the key to all of this was Kelsall's 2012 confessions that he had intrusive thoughts about killing 'a random' with a knife. The truth, Mr McGrath said, was awful but simple - Kelsall killed Mr Huxley for no reason. Daniel Kelsall (centre) is escorted to a prison transport vehicle on Wednesday . Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore . Mark Kelsall, the father of Daniel Kelsall, at court on Wednesday . 'The truth is simple. It is awful, but it is simple. This man killed Morgan Huxley for no reason,' Peter McGrath SC said yesterday. Looking directly at the jury, the crown prosecutor on Tuesday detailed point by point the aspects of the case against the 22-year-old, that, he said, would leave them to infer only one thing. 'This young man Daniel Jack Kelsall in the early hours of September 8, 2013, indecently assaulted Morgan Huxley and then stabbed him to death in his bedroom,' he said. Urging the jury not to be distracted by 'red herrings', Mr McGrath said the crown case against the former junior chef was straight forward and added up. It was not Kelsall, he said, that was in the wrong place at the wrong time but Mr Huxley. 'Chillingly he just happens to be someone who has expressed intrusive, recurring and persistent thoughts about killing someone with a knife on the way home from work. A total stranger. Some random.' Jessica Hall (middle) - the ex-girlfriend of Morgan Huxley - gave evidence at Daniel Jack Kelsall's murder trial in Sydney last week . Rebecca Prins, who was dating Morgan Huxley in the months before his death, is pictured leaving the NSW Supreme Court after giving evidence . But Kelsall had a different story. Taking the stand, Kelsall quietly described how he had struck up a spontaneous conversation with Mr Huxley while the pair were walking home. Kelsall, who pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore. He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, 'Do you want to talk about it?'. 'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, 'Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to'.' Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury. During the sexual encounter that followed, an intruder or intruders burst in and assaulted the pair, causing him to flee. He then wove a string of lies in a bid to 'disassociate' himself from an event which had terrified him. With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed. Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis. 'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said. 'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran. 'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder. 'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said. Mark Kelsall gave evidence last week at the trial of his son Daniel who is accused of killing Morgan Huxley in 2013 in the victim's Sydney apartment . Paramedics Mark Lenehan and David Rigby, who were the first responders to the home of murder victim Morgan Huxley, were pictured arriving at the NSW Supreme Court last week . Citing personal accounts of Kelsall as a caring and bookish boy, his barrister Christopher Watson reminded the jury how the junior chef had left liquorice treats out for his mother on the night of the murder. 'It doesn't sit with a calculated killer,' Mr Watson had said. Mr Huxley's family who all wore yellow roses - signifying his favourite colour - thanked the crown, the jury and the detectives for their dedication to justice. Kelsall's parents said nothing when they left the court. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

Her boyfriend, Hassan Lulu, said he had fallen asleep Tuesday as he and Cherry were flying to Atlanta with two of her three children. 'She just started tapping me,' the 25-year-old Lulu said. 'So I woke up and she told me her water had broke. I really didn't believe it at first. I was like \"Are you sure? Are you OK? You don't think you can wait?\" She said \"No, it's coming now, right now!\"' Scroll down for video . Emergency landing: Shaniqua Cherry, 24, sits in bed with her newborn daughter, Nylah, and her daughter, Malaysha, 3, on Wednesday. Cherry gave birth in Greensboro after her water broke on a flight from Philadelphia to Atlanta that was diverted to Piedmont Triad International Airport . Lulu alerted the flight attendants, who used the intercom to ask if there was a doctor aboard the flight. No one stepped forward. The attendants then announced the plane would be making an emergency landing, Lulu said. 'Everybody was looking left to right, looking around,' Lulu said. 'I was looking at people, everybody trying to figure out what was going on.' American Airlines flight 611 from Philadelphia with 90 passengers aboard diverted to Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro. An ambulance met them on the tarmac to rush Cherry to a hospital, but the baby didn't wait. Cherry delivered a 7-pound girl, Nylah, in the ambulance on her way to Women's Hospital of Greensboro. All five family members were doing well Wednesday. Cherry said her contractions began as the plane took off. They were 40 minutes into the flight when her water broke. 'Yeah, I was kind of scared at first because I didn't know what was going to happen. I didn't want to have it on the plane,' Cherry said. 'I was trying to make it to Atlanta. I was like \"I think I can do it.\" But it just got worse, so they had to stop.' Lulu said the flight was on the ground within 10 minutes after the flight diversion was announced. 'And then I had her in the back of the ambulance on the side of the road, somewhere. I don't know where,' Cherry said. Advice on the website www.babycenter.com suggests that it's generally safe to fly during the third trimester, but expectant mothers should discuss plans with a doctor or midwife before booking a flight. Cherry said her midwife told her that flying two weeks before her due date was fine. On its website, American Airlines says that on domestic flights under five hours, travel is not permitted within seven days before and after a pregnant woman's delivery date. Cherry and Lulu tried to get some rest in their hospital room with her active 2-year-old son, Lamarion, and 3-year-old daughter, Malaysha nearby. Seven-year-old Dayquan was waiting for his baby sister in Atlanta with relatives. Cherry worked for the U.S. Postal Service in Minneapolis before deciding to move to Atlanta to be with her mother, who was having health issues. Lulu worked with his uncle at a smoke shop. They both said they would be starting fresh, and with a story to tell their youngest child in a few years. 'I'm happy she's safe,' Cherry said. 'She's healthy. I'm exhausted, but happy that we have a baby.'

        "input_text": "U.S. narcotics agents with Top Secret clearances had wild 'sex parties' with prostitutes hired by Colombian drug cartel members, according to a blockbuster report from the Justice Department's internal investigations arm. The Drug Enforcement Agency has yet to comment on the findings in the exposé from the DOJ's Office of Inspector General. At least seven DEA agents admitted to investigators that they had sex with hookers while on overseas assignments. But instead of firing or prosecuting them, the agency treated their cases as a 'local management issue' and suspended them for between 2 and 14 days. The IG cautioned in the report, released Thursday morning, that U.S. law enforcement personnel who engage in illicit sex – even in places where it's legal or unofficially tolerated – can be vulnerable to 'coercion, extortion, and blackmail.' The Republican chairman of the congressional panel that specializes in inter-governmental investigations lobbed rhetorical bombs at the Justice Department after the report surfaced online, calling its allegations 'truly stunning.' 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE REPORT . TROUBLE IN COLOMBIA: Drug Enforcement Agency officers had hooker parties allegedly paid for with drug cartel money . NARCO-PERVS: DEA agents had Top Secret clearances when they went on sex romps with hookers . 'We need to hold them accountable and, given the clear evidence in the OIG report, they should be fired immediately,' he said of the offending agents. 'We need to weed out those who risk our national security, embarrass the county, and skirt the law.' Chaffetz promised that his panel, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'will pursue this vigorously' after next week's congressional recess. In all, the IG report flagged 621 cases where agents in the FBI, DEA, ATF and U.S Marchalls Service were accused of a wide variety of sex-related offenses. They ranged from sexting and sexual liaisons between supervisors and subordinates to the consumption of child pornography and sexual abuse of minors and prison imnates. In the prostitudion cases, the IG wrote, 'DEA supervisors treated the alleged misconduct as a local management issue' even though the 'these special agents held Top Secret clearances.' One case involved agents 'patronizing prostitutes and frequenting a brothel while in an overseas posting. ... It was also alleged that one of the subjects in the supervisors’ group assaulted a prostitute following a payment dispute.' 'The Acting Assistant Regional Director who supervised the two special agents in this case,' investigators wrote, 'was also alleged to have solicited prostitutes ... In that case, the AARD allegedly engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes at a farewell party in the AARD’s honor.' 'There were also allegations operational funds were used to pay for the party and the prostitutes who participated.' In all, six hookers attended that soiree. Supervisors allegedly knew about it but never referred the case to the DOJ for disciplinary action. A tipster ultimately blew the whistle on two of the agents, claiming in an anonymous letter to DEA higher-ups that they had frequented prostitutes on a regular basis while on oversead tour-of-duty assignments. In a separate case, the inspector general describes DEA agents who attended prostitute 'sex parties arranged by a Colombian law enforcement officer and funded with money from drug cartels themselves. The parties, the IG said, happened in the agents' government-leased apartments over a period of several years. Agents' laptops, BlackBerry devices, and other government-issued equipment were typically lying around, creating 'potential security risks' and potentially making agents vulnerable to 'extortion, blackmail, or coercion.' Foreign officers later claimed they held on to the American agents' guns  while they were indulging in the hooker-fests. They also claimed they gave three DEA supervisory agents 'money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members.' Ultimately, 7 of the 10 agents the IG interviewed admitted taking part in the 'sex parties.' They were suspended for between 2 and 10 days, but never prosecuted criminally. Overall, the DEA limited its punishment to a maximum of 14 days, in part because Colombian authorities generally turn a blind eye to the sex trade. 'The DEA Inspector told us that prostitution is considered a part of the local culture and is tolerated in certain areas called \"tolerance zones\",' the GI wrote. 'According to the Inspector, it is common for prostitutes to be present at business meetings involving cartel members and foreign officers.' ANGRY: 'Let there be no mistake, this is a national security threat,' said Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz . The DOJ's inspector general found a wide range of sex-related offenses in the case files of the FBI, DEA, ATF and US Marshals Service, including sex with prostitutes and sexual assault of minors . The U.S. Marshalls Service also got a black eye in the inspector general report. In one 2010 case described in detail, two deputy marshalls traevled to Thailand to pick up a criminal defendant who was being extradited to the United States. Every time the State Department tried to contact one of the men, one of two women with foreign accents would answer his phone and say he couldn't be disturbed. 'A local investigator for the State Department spoke to one of the women in Thai' and 'confirmed she was a prostitute,' the IG wrote. When he got home, the deputy was forbidden to travel overseas again. But he fuond a way to conduct at least one more extradition mission anyway and kept his security clearance. A nother deputy 'entered into a romantic relationship' with the spouse of a fugitive criminal suspect. When his supervisors told him to break off the fling, it took him a year to do it. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was relatively unscathed by the IG investigation, with one glaring exception. An ATF Director of Industry Operations, investigators wrote, 'solicited consensual sex with anonymous partners and modified a hotel room door to facilitate sexual play.' Management at the hotel caught him disabling a fire detection system; he insisted he had done it before with no problem. Separately, an FBI Assistant Section Chief who trained his fellow agents on child exploitation and human trafficking issues 'engaged in multiple consensual and commercial sexual encounters over a 7-year period,' according to the report. His partners included 'foreign nationals, including prostitutes, strippers, students in his classes, and members of foreign law enforcement.'

Tairod Nathan . Webster Pugh, 47, was indicted by a grand jury in Brooklyn on Monday for allegedly attempting to provide material support to the group and attempting to obstruct justice. Pugh is an American citizen who previously served as an avionics instrument system specialist in the Air Force. His most recent address according to property records was in Bridgeton, New Jersey. Authorities say he tried to join ISIS earlier this year, weeks after being fired from his job as an airplane mechanic in Kuwait. Scroll down for video . Arrest: The image is believed to show Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh, a U.S. Air Force Veteran who was arrested in January for allegedly attempting to enter Syria to join ISIS. He has now been indicted . On January 10, he allegedly flew from Egypt to Turkey with the intention of crossing the Syrian border to 'fight violent jihad' with ISIS - but Turkish authorities denied him entry and sent him on a flight back to Egypt. Once there, he was found to be carrying suspicious items, including a cell phone photograph of a machine gun  and multiple electronic items, and was deported to the U.S. in January 15. FBI agents allegedly found he had been using his laptop to watch ISIS propaganda videos online and to search for such phrases including 'borders controlled by Islamic state'. They also found a chart on the computer showing crossing points between Turkey and Syria indicating areas on the Syrian side of the border controlled by ISIS. There were also online searches for 'Flames of War', a 55-minute propaganda video, and other footage, including one of ISIS members executing prisoners. Agents also searched two backpacks he used overseas and found they contained compasses, a solar-powered flashlight, a solar-powered power source, a fatigue jacket and camping clothes. Pugh (not pictured) flew from Egypt to Turkey in January with the intention of crossing into Syria to join ISIS (a member is pictured) but he was stopped and sent back to Egypt. From there he was deported to the U.S. Pugh, who told authorities he has a wife in Egypt, was arrested in Asbury Park, New Jersey on January 16 and has been in custody since. The case has been sealed during that time. Pugh is set to be arraigned before a federal judge tomorrow morning in the Eastern . District of New York, where his attorney said he plans to plead not guilty, CNN reported. If convicted of the charges, he faces a maximum sentence of 35 years in prison. Pugh served in the Air Force between 1986 to 1990 and, while there, received training in the installation and maintenance of aircraft engine, navigation, and weapons systems. When he left, he worked for a number of companies in the U.S. and Middle East as an avionics specialist and airplane mechanic. He had been living the Middle East for at least 18 months. His LinkedIn profile shows he last worked as a maintenance manager for the U.S. carrier Gryphon Airlines. Outrage: U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, pictured in January, said Pugh 'turned his back on his country' A Facebook page that appears to belong to him contains multiple anti-Israel photos, calling it 'terrorist country', and anti-Semitic images. In August 2014, he also shared quotes from famous Al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki on the page. His social networking pages also suggests he has two children with a former partner and he was pictured visiting them last year. Still, he wrote on the page that he never wanted to return to the U.S. 'Born and raised in the United States, Pugh allegedly turned his back on his country and attempted to travel to Syria in order to join a terrorist organization,' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. 'We will continue to vigorously prosecute extremists, whether based here or abroad, to stop them before they are able to threaten the United States and its allies.' Assistant Director in Charge Diego G. Rodriguez of the FBI's New York Field Office added: 'U.S. citizens who offer support to terrorist organizations pose a grave threat to our national security and will face serious consequences for their actions.'",

Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran. And he has long faced ethics questions about his relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. But his spokeswoman fiercely denied he has done anything illegal even as a conservative group is calling for him to resign and face the music. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement that 'we believe all of the Senator's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that.' 'Any actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason.' 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' COY: Attorney General Eric Holder wouldn't talk on Friday about whether charges are forthcoming for Menendez, saying 'I can't comment' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' CNN reported that the investigation into Menendez is reaching a crescendo, with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges. Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez’s re-election campaign. The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the presdient's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate mattter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment – principally cargo-container x-ray machines – to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.",

Alex Gibney said in a recent interview he does not understand why Cruise has refused to comment on the numerous claims made against him and Scientology over the years, going so far as to call his silence 'irresponsible.' Among the claims featured in Gibney's documentary, Going Clear, are that Cruise allegedly tapped the phone of his ex-wife Nicole Kidman prior to their split and that he used underpaid workers for his own personal use that were supplied by the church. Scroll down for videos . Speaking out: Alex Gibney (above), the director of the Scientology documentary Going Clear, blasted Tom Cruise after a screening of the film on Monday . The film speaks to former members of the church, one of whom claims that Cruise asked the church to tap Nicole Kidman's phone during their marriage (above during one of their final appearances together) 'Cruise is the big kahuna and that's why we've gone to the trouble of calling him out,' said Gibney following a screening of the film earlier this week according to The Huffington Post. 'We believe that he has a responsibility to say something about the abuse.' He then said of Cruise; 'He can espouse his beliefs, that's fine. But not to address the allegations of abuse seems to me palpably irresponsible.' Mark Rathbun, who goes by Marty, makes some explosive claims about Cruise and current head of the church David Miscavige in Gibney's documentary. Rathbun, who was a top aide to Miscavige, claims that the church did not approve of Cruise's relationship with Kidman, and hoped they would break up once Cruise began to drift away from the church during their marriage. Then, while Cruise was away with Kidman in England working on the Stanley Kurbrick film Eyes Wide Shut, Rathbun claims the actor ordered the church to tap his wife's phone. Rathbun says he was shocked by this demand, but did as he was told. Rathbun, who also claims he was beaten and abused by Miscavige, did not say what, if any, information was obtained through the tapping of Kidman's phone, but the two did split just a few years later, at which time Cruise became a highly vocal supporter of Scientology. There are also claims in the film that church workers being paid less than a dollar an hour are used by Cruise to maintain his collection of motorcycles and his private plane. Mark Rathbun (left) makes some explosive claims about Cruise and current head of the church David Miscavige (right) in Gibney's documentary . 'The accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the Church,' said the Church of Scientology is a statement . 'The accusations made in the film are entirely false and alleged without ever asking the Church,' said the Church of Scientology is a statement. Neither Cruise or Kidman granted Gibney an interview. The church also ran an ad in January - just after the documentary had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival - which appeared in the New York Times, saying; 'The Church has documented evidence that those featured in Gibney’s film regurgitating their stale, discredited allegations are admitted perjurers, admitted liars and professional anti-Scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims. 'All have been gone so long from the Church they know nothing of it today. Yet Gibney and HBO stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the Church to offer relevant information about them, with more than 25 individuals with firsthand information eager to speak. 'To this day, neither HBO nor Gibney can deny that they have yet to present the Church with a single allegation from the film so the Church may have an opportunity to respond. 'The Church never sought special treatment, only fair treatment.' HBO meanwhile had a reported 160 lawyers watch and vet the documentary, which airs at 8pm this Sunday. Lawyers for the Miscavige dispute the claims that their client was ever involved in the tapping of Kidman's phone, that church workers are used by Tom Cruise to maintain his collection of motorcycles and his private plane and that Rathburn was 'beaten and abused' by their client.",

        "input_text": "A medical examiner testifying Thursday in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnev described in graphic detail the devastating injuries that ravaged the body of a 29-year-old woman and caused her to bleed to death on the pavement. One juror cried and wiped her face with a tissue as the jury looked at autopsy photos and listened to the description of injuries suffered by Krystle Campbell. Judge George O'Toole Jr. would not allow the photos to be shown on public monitors, so people in the courtroom could not see the images; only the jurors saw them. Scroll down for video . Karen McWatters lies next to her friend Krystle Campbell (pictured right). Miss Campbell, 29, was one of three people killed in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings . Campbell and her friend Karen Rand  in a photo taken in Boston's public gardens in the hours before the Boston Marathon bombing . Campbell, a restaurant manager, was one of three people killed when twin pressure-cooker bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon on April 15, 2013. More than 260 people were injured, including at least 16 who lost legs in the explosions. Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements at his federal death penalty trial that he participated in the bombings but said he fell under the influence of his late older brother, Tamerlan, whom the defense has portrayed as the mastermind of the terror attack. Dr. Jennifer Hammers, the medical examiner who performed Campbell's autopsy, said she had wounds all over her body, including gaping wounds to her legs, third-degree burns to her back and numerous wounds from BBs and pieces of metal. She said she removed numerous pieces of flat metal and pellets embedded in Campbell's wounds. 'Many of them were very deep, through the whole surface of the skin into the muscle,' Hammers said. Campbell bled to death — but not immediately, Hammers said. 'Based on those injuries, you would estimate that she could have lived for up to a minute?' Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb asked. 'That's correct,' Hammers responded. On Monday, prosecutors plan to call two other medical examiners to testify about the deaths of 8-year-old Martin Richard, a Boston boy who was with his parents, sister and brother at the marathon, and 23-year-old Lingzu Lu, a graduate student at Boston University. After that testimony, prosecutors are expected to rest their case in the first phase of the trial, the guilt phase. Then the defense will present its case, which is expected to be brief since Tsarnaev's lawyers have admitted his guilt. During the second phase of the trial — known as the penalty phase — the same jury will decide if Tsarnaev is sentenced to death or spends the rest of his life in prison. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died days after the attacks when he was wounded during a gunbattle with police and run over by Dzhokhar as he escaped. Dzhokhar was found more than 18 hours later, hiding in a boat parked in a yard in Watertown. He faces the death penalty if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty to the 30 counts against him which also include shooting dead a Boston police officer, Sean Collier. Boston Marathon bombing survivors Heather Abbott, left, and Karen Rand, center, are escorted from federal court on Wednesday after the first day of the trial . Karen McWatters went to the 2013 marathon with Campbell to watch her boyfriend run the race, she testified on the first day of trial. The pair were near the finish line so they could photograph McWatters' boyfriend when the bombs went off. Mrs McWatters said she remembered 'screaming and smoke' and wondered why she was lying on the ground. She looked at her leg and realized 'something terrible had happened to us'. The survivor kept her composure as she testified that although her foot was turned the wrong way and the ground so hot, she made it to Krystle and pressed their faces together. Mrs McWatters said: 'I didn't know how bad she was hurt. She said her legs hurt, then her hand went limp in mine and she never spoke again.'",

And there is a young Hamar girl, also from Ethiopia, whose neck is festooned with hundreds of tiny glass beads and dainty white shells. It seems as if there's no room for any more jewellery but as she has yet to find a husband or have a proposal accepted by her father, there are none of the metal necklaces worn from engagement onwards that denote the social status of married women. Kenny has travelled round 13 African countries photographing traditional tribesmen and women. These include Namibia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mail, Angola, Niger, Togo and Burkina Faso on an odyssey which began in 2006 when he made his first six-month trip to Africa. The end result of these years of work in tribal African societies is a book, ‘Facing Africa’, that was released in late 2013. Back in 2006, he says, 'at the very start of my Africa journey, I was buzzing with energy having met people of real magnetism just days into my trip.

'I was excited by extraordinary people and fascinating cultures and wondered how I could possibly communicate and express these feelings of excitement to friends and family back home.' Kenny's solution was to remove his subjects from all context, shooting them indoors away from what he calls the 'dull and dusty backgrounds of their immediate environment'. He adds: 'I started to imagine each of these people in front of me emerging from the nothingness of darkness, with no distractions, hoping that this would provide a real feeling of proximity between the viewer and the person in the picture.' The result is to bring out the vividness of the colours and the immediacy of the people's expressions - sometimes playful, often intense but always arresting. Kenny says: 'It's simply the illumination of natural sunlight, and sun on dry earth, that reaches into the darkness of huts and lights up these remarkable people.

Robert Jason Owens, 36, a construction worker from North Carolina, was booked on two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday. His charges are in relation to the supposed murder of his Leicester neighbors, celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her  husband Joseph Codd, 45. The couple, whose bodies have not been found, were likely killed on Thursday, according to police. Owens allegedly returned to their home on Sunday and stole their laptop, jewelry and a handgun. Now, it has emerged that Owens was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Linked: Robert Jason Owens, 36, who has been charged with murdering a pregnant Food Network star and her husband, was a key suspect in the disappearance of Zebb Quinn (pictured) 15 years ago, it has emerged . Suspect: Sheriff Van Duncan said Owens (pictured) was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of 18-year-old Quinn, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21 . Believed dead: Owens has been charged with the murder of his Leicester neighbors, celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd (left), 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her husband Joseph Codd (right), 45 . Quinn, who has not been seen since the night of January 2 that year, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told Fox Carolina. Owens later told police that a short while later, Quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over. Quinn then went off to return a page, before returning in a 'frantic' state, Owens said. Cancelling the pair's plans to see the Mitsubishi, Quinn reportedly told Owens he needed to leave and drove off, bumping into his friend's truck on his way. Since that moment, he has been missing. On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was situated at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield. Unanswered questions: Quinn (left), who has not been seen since the night of January 2, 2000, was captured on video buying sodas with Owens (right, in his mug shot in the Codds' murder case) at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. Later that night, the teenager drove off and has not been seen since . Work: Quinn, a Roberson High School graduate, had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. He also enjoyed his work at this Walmart (pictured), his family said at the time . Mother: On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis (pictured), filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, while a pair of lips were drawn on the car's back windshield . It remains unknown who the Labrador-mix puppy - which was around three months old - belonged to. It was later adopted by a police officer, according to The Charley Project cold cases website. In February, police were authorized to take hair, blood and saliva samples from Owens in relation to the disappearance of Quinn, whom his family said would not have gone away of his own accord. Although they never acquired evidence to warrant charges against Owens, Sheriff Van Duncan told The Citizen-Times in Asheville Owens 'was definitely a primary suspect in the Zebb Quinn case'. Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. Speaking to Fox Carolina, the grief-stricken mother added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.' Movie set: Mrs Codd (pictured in a Food Network photo) ) was due to cater on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production when they vanished. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd - she had just announced her firm would be providing food on the set of The Big Short . Home: In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home (pictured). They were both set to leave for work on Sunday - but never made it . Scene: Authorities (pictured at the scene) believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun' In 2012, Quinn's disappearance was featured on the Investigation Discovery Channel show,  'Disappeared', which covered various theories relating to the baffling cold case. One theory revolved around a woman whom Quinn was apparently romantically interested in. The woman, Misty, reportedly had an abusive boyfriend who had made threats toward the teenager. However, Misty and her partner were questioned by police at the time and no arrests were made. Authorities have said said they believe more than one person may have been involved in Quinn’s disappearance and presumed murder. In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. They were both set to leave for work on Sunday. Mrs Codd was catering on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short. The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell. However, authorities believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'. Family members reported the couple missing on Sunday, according to reports. Police have not disclosed whether they have suspicions on how the couple might have been killed. Big names: The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell . Mrs Codd, who grew up in Mississippi,was five months' pregnant with their first child at the time. The Codds' cars and two dogs were found at their home. James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the pair were a 'beautiful couple'. Speaking of Mr Codd, the musician told the Citizen-Times of Mr Codd: 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.' It remains unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in the case. Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday, where he requested an attorney, ABC News 13 reported. His next hearing is scheduled for April 7.",

The German Shepherd mix, Butterbean, was taken into custody by the Humane Society of Louisiana after the owner released her for $400. While the animal was initially thought to be abandoned on the side of the road in Slidell, Louisiana last week, she was reportedly abandoned as a puppy and had been allowed by her owner to live at large  in a nearby neighborhood for six years. Her apparent owner, who is reportedly Lisa Pearson, said that Butterbean loves the man in the truck and that she was following him to work the morning the picture was taken, according to WDSU. The German Shepherd mix captured in the heartbreaking image showing her being abandoned at a gas station has been taken into care. Butterbean, was taken into custody by the Humane Society of Louisiana after the owner released her for $400 . This is the heartbreaking moment from last week when Butterbean was seen desperately chasing after a car where it appeared she was being abandoned at a gas station on the side of a road in Slidell, Louisiana . Butterbean is currently at the Furry Friends Animal Hospital in Harvey, Louisiana, according to ABC. 'We're delighted that this story will have a happy ending,' said Jeff Dorson, the Human Society's founder and executive director, in a memo on Tuesday. The agency has already received applications to adopt Butterbean, and prospective applicants will be interviewed as they work to put her in the best suited home. The dog was captured in the photograph that surfaced last week by witness Lorie Hollis, who said she saw a man drop off the dog near a gas station on Highway 11. She said the man yelled 'Go! Go over there!' Hollis said the animal was confused and jumped up, putting her paws on the tailgate of the man's pickup truck before giving chase after the truck sped off, trying desperately to keep up. After the animal took off after the truck, Hollis got into her car and tried to follow the dog and vehicle, watching the shepherd cross two lanes of traffic as the animal attempted to reach the man. But after driving for a couple of miles, Hollis lost sight of them both. 'My heart is broken,' she told WDSU at the time of the incident. 'I am in shock that someone would treat a dog like this.' Dorson said when animals are abandoned in a 'random location' they have 'almost zero' chance of survival. Butterbean is currently at the Furry Friends Animal Hospital in Harvey, Louisiana, and she will be put up for adoption soon . Applications to adopt her have already been submitted, and prospective applicants will be interviewed as the agency works to put her in the best suited home . Employees at the gas station and neighbors told WDSU last week that the dog was not being abandoned and that the man driving the truck lives in the neighborhood. The Humane Society wrote a post on Facebook about successfully locating Butterbean on March 20. 'When Butterbean was found, she was on the property of a family claiming to have owned her for 6-7 years,' the post said. 'They admitted to allowing her to roam at large during that time and reported that the man in the truck is actually a neighbor who the dog is attached to, who she follows routinely to the gas station. 'Given this information, we are truly amazed that Butterbean has survived these many years.' After Butterbean was found, Pearson said that she intended to keep the dog tethered outside. But following the agency bringing the case to the attention of St. Tammany Animal Control, the owner was issued a warning, and agreed to release the dog for cash. The Humane Society wrote a post on Facebook about successfully locating the animal on March 20 . The owner also signed an agreement not to chain or tether any animal in future or allow them to roam at large. 'We certainly don't like to reward this kind of behavior, but sometimes it simply takes too long for cases to move through the legal system,' said Dorson. 'Our first concern was Butterbean's safety. We were convinced she could be let loose again to run in traffic at any time, and we might miss our opportunity to intervene.' By claiming ownership, the family in question may still be held accountable for violating several ordinances relating to the dog's behavior. Following the incident, the Humane Society is launching a Butterbean's Buddies campaign, which will run for a year, and will help reach more deserving dogs in need. Dorson said Butterbean's story can help shed light on the fact that other Louisiana dogs are chained, abandoned or  neglected each year. A nearby woman snapped the photograph after she saw a man drop off the dog on Highway 11 (pcitured) and yelled at his pet to 'Go! Go over there!' The dog then gave chase after the truck sped off .",

The news comes in the wake of  law S.B. 101, or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, going through in Indiana. In a release, Murray said 'Seattle has been a leader in the fight to protect civil rights and ensure equality for all people – no matter who you are, or who you love. This is why I am ordering that none of our taxpayer dollars should go toward supporting this discriminatory law.' Scroll down for video . Issues: Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, left, plans to sign an executive order that 'will ban City employees from work-related and city-funded travel to the State of Indiana.' Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, right, defended the new state law on Sunday, and said it wasn't a mistake to have enacted it . The release said 'To formalize the Mayor's decision, he will be issuing an executive order next week. The order will ban City employees from work-related and city-funded travel to the State of Indiana.' Last week, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee also called SB 101 'discriminatory' in a Thursday statement. He said 'We stand united as San Franciscans to condemn Indiana's new discriminatory law, and will work together to protect the civil rights of all Americans including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. 'Effective immediately, I am directing City Departments under my authority to bar any publicly-funded City employee travel to the State of Indiana that is not absolutely essential to public health and safety.' Indiana Gov. Mike Pence defended the new state law that's garnered widespread criticism over concerns it could foster discrimination on Sunday, and said it wasn't a mistake to have enacted it. Pence appeared on ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' to discuss the measure he signed last week prohibiting state laws that 'substantially burden\" a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The definition of 'person' includes religious institutions, businesses and associations. Since the Republican governor signed the bill into law Thursday, Indiana has been widely criticized by businesses and organizations around the nation, as well as on social media with the hashtag (hash)boycottindiana. Already, consumer review service Angie's List has said it will suspend a planned expansion in Indianapolis because of the new law. Outrage: Since the Republican governor signed the bill into law Thursday, Indiana has been widely criticized by businesses and organizations around the nation . Changes: Already, consumer review service Angie's List has said it will suspend a planned expansion in Indianapolis because of the new law . Pence did not answer directly when asked at least six times whether under the law it would be legal for a merchant to refuse to serve gay customers. 'This is not about discrimination, this is about empowering people to confront government overreach,' he said. Asked again, he said, 'Look, the issue here is still is tolerance a two-way street or not.' Pence told the Indianapolis Star on Saturday that he was in discussions with legislative leaders over the weekend and expects a clarification bill to be introduced in the coming week. He addressed that Sunday, saying, 'if the General Assembly ... sends me a bill that adds a section that reiterates and amplifies and clarifies what the law really is and what it has been for the last 20 years, then I'm open to that.' But Pence was adamant that the measure, slated to take effect in July, will stick. 'We're not going to change this law,' Pence said. Some national gay-rights groups say it's a way for lawmakers in Indiana and several others states where such bills have been proposed this year to essentially grant a state-sanctioned waiver for discrimination as the nation's highest court prepares to mull the gay marriage question. Supporters of the law, including Pence, contend discrimination claims are overblown and insist it will keep the government from compelling people to provide services they find objectionable on religious grounds. They also maintain courts haven't allowed discrimination under similar laws covering the federal government and 19 other states. Arkansas is poised to follow in Indiana's footsteps, with a final vote expected next week in the House on legislation that Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson has said he'll sign. Josh Earnest, President Barack Obama's spokesman, appeared on 'This Week' just after Pence, and said the debate isn't a political argument. Thousands of opponents of Indiana Senate Bill 101, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are seen Saturday on the lawn of the Indiana State House . 'If you have to go back two decades to try to justify what you're doing today, it may raise questions,' Earnest said, referring to the 1993 federal law Pence brought up. He added that Pence 'is in damage-control mode this morning and he's got some damage to fix.' State Rep. Ed DeLaney, an Indianapolis Democrat, told a large, boisterous crowd Saturday gathered outside of the Statehouse to protest that the law creates 'a road map, a path to discrimination.' Rally attendees chanted 'Pence must go!' several times and held signs that read 'No hate in our state.' Pence addressed the critics Sunday, saying: 'This avalanche of intolerance that's been poured on our state is just outrageous.' Asked if he would be willing to add sexual orientation to the list of characteristics against which discrimination is illegal, he said, 'I will not push for that. That's not on my agenda, and that's not been an objective of the people of the state of Indiana.' U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, released a video statement on his Facebook page Saturday, saying: 'We'll work together to reverse SB101 and we'll stand together to make sure that here in Indiana, we welcome everyone, every day.' Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican who opposed the law, has said he and other city officials will talk with businesses and convention planners to counter the uproar. Angie's List had sought an $18.5 million incentive package from Indianapolis' City-County Council to add 1,000 jobs over five years. But founder and CEO Bill Oseterle said in a statement Saturday that the expansion was on hold 'until we fully understand the implications of the freedom restoration act on our employees.' The Indianapolis-based NCAA has expressed concerns about the law and has suggested it could move future events elsewhere; the men's Final Four will be held in the city next weekend.",

        "input_text": "When 16-year-old Billy Flynn gunned down the husband of his high school instructor and lover, Pamela Smart, in 1990, the trial became an instant tabloid sensation. Its lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books. Twenty-five years after Gregg Smart's killing, Pamela Smart remains in prison serving life without the possibility of parole and Flynn makes his first bid for parole Thursday, his 41st birthday. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. Flynn was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus credit for pretrial incarceration. Here's a look at some key details in the case: . Teacher:  Pamela Smart (seen in this 1991 file photo) was convicted of conspiring with her 15 year-old lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24 year-old husband, Greggory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Student: In this 1991 file photo, William Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Greggory Smart in the head and killed him. Flynn pleaded guilty to killing Smart and  has a parole hearing scheduled for Thursday . The plot . According to trial testimony, Smart was 22 and one of Flynn's instructors in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced the 15-year-old Flynn. She told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced Gregg Smart as their wedding anniversary approached. Flynn said he and three cohorts bungled an attempt to kill Smart in April, when they got lost on the way there. But on May 1, 1990, he and 18-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Smart was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Life in prison: Flynn (seen in January 2008) married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license . Media circus: The trials's lurid details aired gavel-to-gavel on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle and spawned movies and books . Sensational trial . Smart's trial was the first in the country to be televised nationally from start to finish, her trial lawyer, Mark Sisti, said ruefully. 'Her trial turned into the ultimate daytime TV drama, and the witnesses were dressing up for it and performing rather than testifying,' Sisti said. Hers was also one of the first high-profile trials involving a teacher-student sex affair. Stories of the trial and Flynn's testimony about their affair were picked up internationally, and cameras caught every graphic image and detail. 'We're a voyeuristic society,' said veteran trial lawyer and University of New Hampshire School of Law professor Buzz Scherr. 'We like looking at other people's dirty laundry.' And, Scherr noted: 'This one had it all.' Parole pitch . Parole files in New Hampshire are not public record, and Flynn's lawyer, Cathy Green, declined to say what Flynn would tell the board. Seven years ago, testifying on his motion for a reduced sentence, a tearful Flynn took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. 'I promise you I will carry this guilt and remorse with me every day for the rest of my life,' he said. Gregory Smart's father, William, told Flynn then that he might be prepared to see him go free when Flynn reached 40 but that he wasn't ready yet. William Smart has since died. Flynn married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license. 'This never would have happened if it wasn't for Pam Smart,' said attorney Paul Maggiotto, who prosecuted Smart. 'It was Smart's manipulation of Flynn that caused this crime to occur.' Flynn's age and testimony against Smart were taken into account at sentencing. 'I desperately want you to know I'm not that weak person anymore,' Flynn said in 2008. Students: In May 1990, Patrick Randall (left) and Billy Flynn (right) entered the Smarts' condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head . On the big screen: The case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix . Flynn, who is serving out his sentence in Maine, will not be present at the parole board hearing. He will address the board on speakerphone (file photo) Smart's stance . Smart has been at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for women in New York since her transfer for unspecified security reasons in March 1993. Her friend and spokeswoman, Eleanor Pam, told The Associated Press that Smart is not taking a position on Flynn's parole bid but chafes at her life sentence without the chance at freedom that the triggerman is getting. Smart told her: 'If they look at Flynn, they really should take a look at me.' Pam said that while Smart acknowledges the affair with Flynn led to the series of events leading up to her husband's death, she maintains she didn't plan it. What to expect Thursday . Flynn, who is serving out his sentence in Maine, will not be present at the parole board hearing. He will address the board on speakerphone. Gregg Smart's family members and friends have a right to make victim impact statements. State prosecutors will also weigh in. The three board members are expected to confer among themselves without leaving the hearing room at the state prison in Concord and then render a decision. If parole is granted, Flynn would not be freed before his parole eligibility date of June 4 and only after his final parole plan is approved by the board.",

        "input_text": "A freshman senator who spearheaded a letter to Iranian leaders, cautioning them that any deal negotiated by the Obama administration would not outlast the current president, defended his actions on Tuesday as necessary to prevent the Middle Eastern country from becoming nuclear capable. 'They’ve been killing Americans for 35 years, they’ve killed hundreds of troops in Iraq, now they control five capitols in the Middle East,'Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Tuesday on MSNBC. 'They are nothing but hardliners in Iran and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon, imagine what they would do with one.' Cotton's remarks came after Vice President Joe Biden, the official president of the Senate and a former representative for Delaware to the upper chamber, sent out a biting statement Monday evening accusing letter signers of acting 'beneath the dignity' of their office. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'They’ve been killing Americans for 35 years, they’ve killed hundreds of troops in Iraq, now they control five capitols in the Middle East,' Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Tuesday on MSNBC program Morning Joe while defending his controversial letter to Iranian leaders . The letter, signed by 47 Republican senators, told Iranians the Senate will 'consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei.' Reminding the foreign government that U.S. President Barack Obama is ineligible for a third term and will leave office in January 2017, ' the GOP lawmakers said 'most of us will remain in office well beyond then – perhaps decades.' In previewing the letter to Bloomberg, Cotton said Monday 'Iran's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that … any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril.' The White House, State Department and Democratic leaders denounced the audacious move and warned that it could have the intended effect - the dismantlement of the Obama and other world leaders' blossoming agreement with Tehran. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said it 'undermines' negotiations. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said it 'certainly interferes' with ongoing talks. Republicans' effort to 'essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful,' Earnest told reporters during his daily briefing on Monday. Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at Republicans on Monday night in a statement distributed to reporters through the White House's massive press list. The message, 'expressly designed to undercut a sitting President in the midst of sensitive international negotiations, is beneath the dignity of an institution I revere,' Biden said, arguing that he had never seen anything like it during his thirty-six years in the Senate. 'I cannot recall another instance in which Senators wrote directly to advise another country—much less a longtime foreign adversary— that the President does not have the constitutional authority to reach a meaningful understanding with them,' he said. 'This letter sends a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our Commander-in-Chief cannot deliver on America’s commitments—a message that is as false as it is dangerous.' Firing back at the VP on Tuesday morning during an appearance on Morning Joe, Cotton said if Biden 'respects the dignity of the institution of the Senate he should be insisting that the president submit any deal to approval of the Senate, which is exactly what he did on numerous deals during his time in Senate.' He also attacked Biden's foreign policy credentials. 'Joe Biden, as Barack Obama’s own secretary of defense has said, has been wrong about nearly every foreign policy and national security decision in the last 40 years,' Cotton said in remarks captured by Politico. The Arkansas lawmaker was referring to former DOD head Robert Gates, who deprecated Biden in a memoir released after he exited Obama's cabinet. Biden, another likely candidate for president in 2016, is a former chairman of the Senate's Foreign Relation's Committee. He was initially added to Obama's ticket in 2008 to counter the freshman senator's relative lack of experience with world affairs. He was not alone in his condemnation of his former colleagues' actions. Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Republicans' 'very blatant effort to undermine the legitimacy' of the president and 'disrespect' his as a negotiator is 'unconscionable.' They essentially said the president 'doesn't speak for the Constitution,' he told CNN Tuesday morning. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine lambasted Cotton and his co-signers Tuesday on the Senate floor, even while conceding that he partially agrees with their position. 'I share many of the concerns of my colleagues, the 47 who wrote the letter,' Kaine said. 'But I deeply believe, ' he added, 'we should not try to tank a deal, critique a deal, undercut a deal, before there is a deal. ' He criticized Cotton without naming him, for writing 'to the leader of a nation that we characterize as a terrorist state.' 'The message that is communicated to the American public and to the world is, we will never accept any deal,' he said of the letter. 'We are not interested in diplomacy. We are not interested in negotiation.' 'And that attitude plays directly into the hands of the nation of Iran, which is currently engaging in terrorist activity. Thy would want to be able to blame the absence of any deal on an intransigent the United States that is unwilling to negotiate in good faith.' Iran's foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said Tuesday, 'This kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic.' 'In fact it implies that the United States is not trustworthy,' he said according to Iran's state-run news site. The letter, signed by 47 Republican senators, told Iranians the Senate will 'consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei' The White House on Monday reproached senators for acting outside 'the role our Founding Fathers envisioned Congress for to play when it comes to foreign affairs' and questioned the 'wisdom of their strategy.' 'The rush to war, or at least the to the military option that many Republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the United States,' Earnest said. Republicans have not specifically lobbied for military engagement with Iran, but its the White House's view that war could come about if world leaders do not at least attempt to negotiate a deal with Iran in good faith. Psaki contended Monday that senators wrongly implied that they have any say over a possible agreement. 'Congress doesn't have the power to alter the conditions of international arrangements negotiated by the executive,' she said. Additionally, the State Department is of the opinion 'that this letter, designed to score political points, ignores the fact that executive agreements between countries provide things like protections for troops, that we rely on every day, allows for the basing of American service members overseas, allows for us to obstruct the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction on the high seas,' she said. While it is true that Congress does not currently have the authority to authorize the pact as it's not technically a treaty, the Senate will soon vote on a bipartisan measure that would give the legislative body the power of review over any package the administration offers Iran. And, as Cotton noted Tuesday morning on CNN's New Day, several of the Republican senators who lent their name to the letter are considering presidential bids and could, in two years, potentially be calling the shots in the Oval Office. 'I welcome even Hillary Clinton to join us because I suspect she might have reservations about this ill-fated nuclear deal as well,' he said, name-checking the Democratic front-runner for president. Vice President Joe Biden, pictured here at the International Association of Firefighters Legislative Conference and Presidential Forum on Monday, sent out a biting statement that evening accusing letter signers of acting 'beneath the dignity' of their office . From left, Secretary of State John Kerry, Biden and National Security Adviser Susan Rice listen as President Barack Obama meets with European Council President Donald Tusk in the Oval Office on Monday. The State Department said the GOP's letter to Iran 'undermines' nuclear negotiations. The White House said it 'certainly interferes' with ongoing talks . Asked about the GOP senators' attempt to undercut his foreign policy strategy on Monday, Obama said he thought it was 'ironic' that they were aligning themselves with Iran's hardliners, who also don't want a deal to go through. In his unusually long statement, Biden said the senators' letter, sent 'in the guise of a constitutional lesson, ignores two centuries of precedent and threatens to undermine the ability of any future American President, whether Democrat or Republican, to negotiate with other nations on behalf of the United States.' 'Around the world, America’s influence depends on its ability to honor its commitments.' The United States must 'maintain our credibility and global leadership even as Presidents and Congresses come and go,' he wrote. 'The decision to undercut our President and circumvent our constitutional system offends me as a matter of principle,' he continued. 'As a matter of policy, the letter and its authors have also offered no viable alternative to the diplomatic resolution with Iran that their letter seeks to undermine.' Republicans have said that instead of diplomatic negotiations and a deal that would allow Iran to continue working toward a peaceful nuclear program, they would like to bury the country with sanctions until it completely abandons its Uranium enrichment program. Blumenthal said Tuesday that Cotton and other legislators had polarized and undermined a bipartisan coalition of senators 'which is now in tatters' that were demanding the White House allow the Senate to have the final say over any deal it negotiated with Tehran. The Democratic senator said he was determined to 'stitch it back together,' however. Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said the irony of the situation was that the Senate's bill, sponsored by Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, requiring congressional oversight was headed toward a veto-proof majority before this. Now, Republican have 'blown that,' he said on CNN, and 'literally snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.'",
        "summary": "Arkansas' Tom Cotton authored the letter that was signed by 47 Republican senators and sent to Iranian leaders on Monday .\nThey are nothing but hardliners in Iran and if they do all of those things without a nuclear weapon, imagine what they would do with one,' he said .\nThe State Department said it 'undermines' negotiations. The White House said it 'certainly interferes' with ongoing talks .\nBiden said it sends 'a highly misleading signal to friend and foe alike that that our Commander-in-Chief cannot deliver on America’s commitments—a message that is as false as it is dangerous'\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Republicans' 'very blatant effort to undermine' Obama and 'disrespect' him is 'unconscionable'\nIran's foreign minister said, 'This kind of communication is unprecedented and undiplomatic' and 'implies that the United States is not trustworthy'"

        "input_text": "A fight over a handicapped parking spot ended with a 71-year-old woman being hospitalized with a broken leg and the need for a second hip replacement. The confrontation at the Walmart store on West Layton Avenue in Greenfield, Wisconsin, saw two women, both with handicapped tags on their cars, face off over the space. Kezia Perkins, 32, was attempting to park in the handicapped spot, but couldn't make the turn into the space. That's when the unidentified 71-year-old woman pulled in instead in her SUV. Surveillance footage from February 3 shows Perkins block in the SUV, then get out of her car and move around to the driver's window, out of sight. Perkins can been on surveillance footage rushing around the back of her car to confront the 71-year-old woman that cut across her to get to the handicap spot . Bystanders described how Perkins walked up to the older woman and 'chest-butted' her causing her to fall backwards . She hit the ground hard and rolled onto her side in pain, having recently had a hip replacement - the fall broke her leg . As Perkins began to return to her car, witnesses rushed forward to help the older woman who lay on the ground in agony . She returned to her own car, appeared to look for something in her trunk and then went back to the other vehicle and yelled through the passenger side window. Perkins once again returned to her own car, and after a brief moment the SUV driver emerged and began to walk around the vehicle towards the store. The footage shows the two women exchanging words over the roof of Perkins' car before she rushes around the back of it and appears to shove the older woman to the ground. The 71-year-old hit the ground hard and rolled onto her side in pain as Perkins began to return to her car. Bystanders, including John Rawlins of West Allis, rushed to help the woman who was now laying in the slush and ice. Kezia Perkins, 32, was attempting to park in a handicapped spot at Walmart when the driver of an SUV cut her off and pulled into the spot . 'From what she told me when I was tending to her, she just had hip surgery done. She couldn`t move. It may have come undone,' Rawlins told Fox 6. Perkins was charged on Wednesday with felony aggravated battery and appears in court next week . In describing what happened he said: 'This lady chest-butted,' referring to Perkins. Perkins is alleged to have told police: 'it’s not my fault the elderly woman bounced off my big (chest).' When Greenfield police checked her license and handicapped tag they found that the license wasn't valid and the tag wasn't even registered in her name. Perkins was charged on Wednesday with felony aggravated battery, and could face six years in prison if convicted and up to $10,000 in fines. She appears in court next week. Police said that the victim went through five hours of surgery after she was attacked to fix fractures to her femur. She also needed a second hip replacement. Perkins' lawyer issued a statement maintaining her innocence and that she is handicapped. 'This was an unfortunate accident that came about after a misunderstanding between two individuals. Ms. Perkins is, herself, disabled, however the fact that her disability is not immediately noticeable led to confusion between the two women.'",

        "input_text": "Foul-mouthed: Jeremy Clarkson (pictured last night) told guests at The Roundhouse Gala in north London that his bosses were 'f****** b*******' Jeremy Clarkson last night launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at BBC bosses during a charity gala. The Top Gear star,  speaking in north London to raise money to help disadvantaged youths, said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show's track 'before the 'f****** b******* sack me'. Clarkson - whom the BBC has suspended over claims he punched a producer - told guests at The Roundhouse Gala that the driving series 'was a great show and they've f***** it up'. A video of his speech emerged as it was claimed last night that Clarkson visited his producer's home to apologise for their Top Gear altercation - but was given the cold shoulder. In footage obtained by the Daily Mirror, he spoke to the Roundhouse audience about a charity auction for his 'last ever lap' on the Top Gear track - which later went for £100,000. Clarkson said: 'I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap. So I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the f****** b******* sack me. 'I'll be a bit tearful when I do it, but f*** it, let's do it. And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of. I'm sacked so it's probably an Austin Maestro.' He added: 'There was an 18-year waiting list to be in the audience of Top Gear, but the BBC has f***** themselves.' Last night, a report claimed that the BBC probe into the row had been told producer Oisin Tymon refused to even open the door to Clarkson after he turned up at his house. Sources said the incident happened four days after 54-year-old Clarkson allegedly punched Mr Tymon during an argument after filming over a hot meal at a North Yorkshire hotel. The claims emerged as it was revealed Clarkson and his co-presenters Richard Hammond and James May are still scheduled to host a Top Gear Live arena show in Norway next week. Rant: Clarkson speaks on stage, next to Pink Floyd's Nick Mason, during The Roundhouse Gala last night . Support: This evening Clarkson thanked all the people who have called for him to remain as presenter . The top-rating show was pulled off air and Clarkson was suspended while an inquiry was launched. It has also been claimed that Clarkson has sent at least one apologetic email to Mr Tymon. Ken MacQuarrie, the BBC executive in charge of the inquiry, has reportedly been shown the contents of the emails. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'In the hours before he reported the matter to the BBC, Clarkson seemed increasingly desperate to apologise to Oisin and persuade him to let the matter blow over. 'When he arrived on the doorstep that Sunday, Oisin was not feeling ready to face him so didn't answer. He just didn't want to speak to him after what happened. Bids: Clarkson (centre), sitting next to journalist Christa D'Souza (left) and Nettie Mason (right) - wife of Pink Floyd's Nick Mason - during the live auction at the gala, to raise money to help disadvantaged youths . Guests: Clarkson (left) with Sally and Ronnie Wood (right) at The Roundhouse Gala in north London last night . 'Clarkson could be heard saying that he just wanted to talk. He was asking for the door to be opened but it didn't work. He tried for up to five minutes but in the end had to walk away.' Today, the BBC was given another reminder of the strength of support behind Clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank. The vehicle, apparently driven by the motoring show's enigmatic professional driver The Stig, made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street. Fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the Change.org petition, started by political website Guido Fawkes. The petition, launched last week, reads: 'We the undersigned petition the BBC to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson. Freedom to fracas. #BringBackClarkson'.' Although Top Gear is now off air, tickets are still on sale for the four performances of the live show in Norway, next Friday and Saturday. Up to 5,000 people are expected to attend each one. Claim: The BBC investigation into the row has been told producer Oisin Tymon (right) refused to even open the door to presenter Jeremy Clarkson (left) after he turned up at his home, according to a report . Petition is delivered: A man dressed as The Stig is pictured leading a tank charge to the BBC offices in London today to hand over one million signatures to bring back Jeremy Clarkson . City route: The vehicle made its way from Westminster, through central London and towards New Broadcasting House near Oxford Street . Meanwhile, it was also revealed last night that Clarkson's future on the BBC is likely to be decided next week when the corporation's internal probe into his behaviour is given to the director-general. A BBC Worldwide source told The Daily Telegraph: 'At the moment we are taking things on a day by day basis and as things stand the [Norway] shows are scheduled to run as billed. 'It is not happening tomorrow, it is happening in eight days' time, so we are waiting to see what the investigation delivers. 'No-one is really sure about the timing of the investigation's decision, so before we disappoint 20,000 fans in Norway, at the moment we are going ahead with the show.' Clarkson has been suspended since it emerged he was involved in what the BBC called 'a fracas' with one of the show's producers. It was reported this week that Clarkson's Top Gear co-hosts declined an offer to continue the rest of the series without him. The last episodes of the series have been postponed, causing the BBC to lose millions of viewers and receive thousands of complaints.

        "input_text": "Thousands of users of an online prescription service have had their data sold without their knowledge, a Mail investigation can reveal today. Their names and addresses have been handed to companies that target the sick. Many of the patients used the Pharmacy 2U service because they were disabled or too ill to travel to their nearest surgery. Others used the firm’s online doctor consultations. Scroll down for video . Pharmacy 2U, an online prescription service, has sold patients information to marketing companies without their knowledge . Pharmacy 2U, which is the country’s leading NHS approved online pharmacy, even gave the patients’ email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to a marketing firm. MPs said the company was putting thousands of patients at risk and should face a police probe. The revelations come amid a growing outcry over the Mail’s reporting on how sensitive medical and financial data is being sold to conmen and criminals. Today we can also reveal that: . Following a major investigation, the Mail this week revealed how financial details of thousands of people – including details of their incomes, investments and pension pots – were being sold for as little as 5p to cold callers and fraudsters. The prescription company even gave the patients’ email addresses, dates of birth and date of their last prescriptions to firms . And our disclosures yesterday included how undercover reporters were also able to buy private medical details – including names of people suffering from arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and even bladder problems – for just 19p each. Some of this information on sick and disabled people is ending up in the hands of conmen and criminals who prey on the most vulnerable. Now it can be revealed that details of NHS patients who have bought prescriptions online are also being offered for sale. The details sold to Alchemy Direct Media by Pharmacy 2U, which has a turnover of £17million a year, include the names and addresses of people who have requested online doctor consultations using the site. On its website, Alchemy described those on the list as people who had used Pharmacy 2U to ‘place their GP prescriptions and have them delivered to their home address’. Andy Burnham, Labour's health spokesman, has described this as an 'extremely serious matter' The details appear to have been passed on without the proper consent of patients. When registering for online prescriptions, patients using Pharmacy2U have to agree to terms and conditions but these do not cover anything about their information being passed on to third parties. That is only stated in the small print of the website’s privacy policy. Pharmacy2U admitted to the Mail that it had sold the names and addresses of ‘up to 5,000’ patients on three occasions, refusing to say how much it had charged. It said it had decided to stop selling the information and stressed no medical data had been passed on. But Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘This is an extremely serious matter. The Government must initiate an inquiry and call in the police to see if a crime has been committed. Pharmacy2U should immediately be suspended as an approved distributor. ‘Jeremy Hunt has failed in his primary duty to protect vulnerable patients. He must make an urgent statement to set out how widespread this practice is, whether there have been other breaches and what action is being taken against Pharmacy2U.’ Dr Sarah Wollaston, the outgoing Tory chairman of the health select committee, called for a criminal investigation into Pharmacy2U. She said: ‘This is awful. It is just beyond belief that anyone working for this company could have thought it reasonable to sell these records. If people forward their prescriptions to a pharmacy they should never expect that to be anything other than totally confidential. ‘The CEO of this company should be personally held to account. Did he know about this? People should never use this online service again. ‘I just can’t see how this could be legal. It is a whole other level. I hope the police will investigate.’ Andrew Percy, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘This is the most disgraceful breach of trust. ‘People access NHS services with an expectation that everything about it will be private. ‘Patients would never expect that when using an NHS approved pharmacy service their details would then be sold on. The Mail’s undercover team contacted Data Bubble, which is run by Mrs Clayton, and found its selling sensitive pension details for as little as 19p . ‘This is putting our most vulnerable people at risk. It is a complete outrage and must stop immediately.’ Tory MP Charlotte Leslie, who sat on the health select committee, said the fact that NHS patients’ details were sold on was ‘incredibly concerning’. She said that firms should not be selling data without ‘people’s explicit knowledge and their explicit consent.’ The Mail’s revelations on the sale of medical and financial data have sparked a major inquiry by the office of the Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham. Nick Sayer, a director of B2C Data, offered to sell details of 15,000 people to undercover reporters in a Mail expose this week . Yesterday Mr Graham praised the Mail’s investigation and rubbished the firms’ claims that people ‘opted in’ to having their medical details sold on. He said: ‘It’s just beyond belief that people have signed up to be col called about their bladder problems. ‘What the Daily Mail team appear to have discovered is that there’s a nice little trade going between different commercial companies where our personal info has value to others.’ A spokesman for Pharmacy 2U said: ‘Only name and address information has been sold and no permission for any other data to be sold has been provided by Pharmacy2U. ‘Alchemy Direct Media (UK) Ltd work for Pharmacy2U under a strict agreement and other data was provided to them under that agreement for internal purposes, such as understanding the recency of the data, but not for sale to external parties. ‘This type of data processing for companies by their agencies is normal business practice. No medication information or data relating to medical conditions has been shared with Alchemy Direct Media (UK) Ltd.’ Michael Smith, managing director of Alchemy Direct Media, said: ‘We are an ICO registered company and are satisfied that the information held on this database complies with current data protection and ICO regulation.’",

Ford has a passion for flying, but wife of five years, Calista Flockhart, 50, is strongly urging her 72-year-old husband that now is the time to call it quits because he might not be so fortunate next time. Ford suffered multiple injuries, including a fractured pelvis and broken ankle, when he crash landed his 1940s aircraft onto a Californian golf course, but he is expected to make a full recovery. Calista Flochart, 50, was pictured on Sunday on her way to UCLA hospital looking relieved and almost smiling as it emerged that Ford could be out as early as next week . The Ally McBeal star is strongly urging her 72-year-old husband Harrison Ford that now is the time to call it quits as a pilot after his lucky escape from a plane crash last Thursday . The Star Wars-star has a passion for flying his prized collection of planes . 'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' a friend of the actress told The Mirror. 'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby. 'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is ­obviously a huge worry.' The Ally McBeal star was pictured on Sunday on her way to UCLA hospital looking relieved and almost smiling as it emerged that Ford could be out as early as next week. Flockhart isn't the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend, Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy. Bloodied: Harrison Ford is carried away from the scene of his plane crash on Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles on Thursday . Wreckage: Harrison Ford is believed to have suffered a pelvic fracture, ankle injuries, and multiple bruises and cuts after crashing his vintage single-engine plane . Addressing Harrison, she told PEOPLE magazine: 'I know you have incredible bounce back, please take a bounce break for awhile. Can I drive next time?' Fisher, who plays Princess Leia in the films, told The Mail on Sunday that she had a car smash in Los Angeles last Sunday – and now fears that one of her other co-stars will also suffer an accident. 'Things happen in threes,' she said. 'I'm about to call Mark Hamill [who plays Luke Skywalker] to make sure he's OK. I have a horrid feeling there's a curse going on here.' Ford, 72, remained in hospital last night after crashing his vintage single-engine plane on Thursday. It is believed he suffered a pelvic fracture, ankle injuries, and multiple bruises and cuts. The superstar was hailed as a hero for avoiding a densely populated area of Los Angeles after the engine failed. He brought the plane down on a golf course. Fisher, 58, met Ford when they starred in the original Star Wars film in 1977, in which he played daredevil Han Solo. Young guns: Harrison Ford (left), Carrie Fisher (Centre) and Mark Hamill (right) in 1977's Star Wars . Fisher (pictured), who plays Princess Leia in the films, has revealed that she was in a car smash in Los Angeles last Sunday . They have remained close friends and appear in the next instalment of the franchise. It was filmed in the UK last summer and is due for release in December. Fisher, who is known for her eccentric views on life, said: 'What is funny is that last Sunday it was raining hard in LA. I was driving to the art store and I got into an accident. 'It wasn't that serious and I wasn't hurt but it's the first car accident I've ever had. I drove home and that's when the wheel came off my BMW. My assistant told me I could have died if the wheel had come off when I was on the freeway.' Laughing, she added: 'Then I was watching the news and saw Harrison had his crash. 'I'm a bit worried it's the curse of Star Wars. 'The thing about Harrison is that he's always the coolest dude in the room. He just oozes manly manliness. I'm not surprised he landed the plane in one piece and survived.' Fisher has not spoken to Ford since the crash, but has sent him some beer. She explained that on one occasion they were planning to fly together. 'I was messing around and he said, 'Look, do you want to fly or can we have a beer?' 'He wouldn't have a drink if we were going to fly. It became something of a joke between us that I chose to have a beer that time rather than fly. I sent him some beers to the hospital with the message, 'You should have had a beer this time.' She added: 'He's primal. As a woman you feel safe with him. I fully expect he will be back up there soon – even if he's told he's not allowed to. Harrison isn't someone who follows the normal rules.' According to the Los Angeles Times, Ford is 'uninsurable'. In 1999 the father of five crashed his helicopter in the desert north of Los Angeles after the motor failed. A year later he was forced to crash-land a plane in Nebraska. Fisher said Ford's accident last summer on the set of Star Wars VII – when the door of the Millennium Falcon dropped on to his leg, shattering it – was 'more serious than was let on'. She added: 'It could have been billions of times worse.'",

Diver first came to prominence as a result of his remarkable survival when he was pulled out of the rubble on August 2 1997, some 65 hours after a landslide wrought havoc across Thredbo. The disaster killed his then wife Sally and 17 others. Stuart Diver and Rosanna Cossettini married on April 13, 2002 in a ceremony in the Snowy Mountains, she was 27 and he was 32. Rosanna was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer just three weeks after their nuptials but went into remission. Sadly, the cancer had returned by July, 2013. She passed away on Saturday aged 40. A short statement has been issued on behalf of the Diver family. It simply reads: 'Stuart Diver and his extended family have requested privacy and respect for their loss at this time.' Scroll down for video . Thredbo landslide survivor Stuart Diver is mourning the loss of his wife Rosanna (left) who died at the weekend . August 2, 1997. This photograph was taken moments after Stuart Diver was freed from the rubble on August 2, 1997, after spending 65 hours buried in the rubble. Mr Diver lost his first wife Sally in the tragedy . Stuart Diver (left) pictured with paramedic Paul Featherstone (right) at his retirement in 2013. Mr Featherstone is credited for helping keep him alive while trapped under the Thredbo landslide rubble . In June last year, he told The Australian: 'Obviously, secondary breast cancers are not nice, there’s never a good outcome at the end.' 'But we’re doing everything we can, throwing everything at it, with Alessia being 3½, we’re trying to stay as positive as we can.' Stuart Diver, 45, met his future wife, Rosanna Cossettini, two years after the Thredbo tragedy, which claimed his first wife’s life. Rosanna Cossettini married Stuart Diver in April, 2002 at Coolringdon, near Cooma in south-west NSW. Mrs Diver passed away on Saturday after a lengthy battle with breast cancer . Guests of the couple gather to celebrate their wedding at Crackenback Cottage April 2002 . Stuart Diver pictured two years after the Thredbo landslide. He has been a much-sought after public speaker since the tragedy and continued to work on the ski fields . In his memoir Stuart wrote that: ‘I’d see Rosanna Cossettini now and then at the pub or walking around the village. We would chat but I never thought it would really amount to anything.' 'I figured she was way too good to go out with a rogue like me.’ His connection with Rosanna, he remembered, was truly special and she played a huge role in helping him heal from the trauma of his wife Sally’s death. ‘I had always believed that if it was right in your heart, then it was right,' he wrote of finding love after Sally's tragic passing. 'With Rosanna, I found myself loving again.' At the time they ran the Snow Cloud Ski Lodge in the Woodridge section of Thredbo village together. In 2007, they set about building their dream home at Tura Beach on the South Coast. Stuart Diver with his first wife, Sally (pictured). He wrote in his memoir that his connection with Rosanna was truly special and she played a huge role in helping him heal from the trauma of her death . Stuart Diver at the then launch of his remarkable tale \"Survival: The inspirational story of the Thredbo disaster's sole survivor\" Stuart wrote in his 2012 autobiography: ‘I knew in my heart that Sal would have wanted me to get on with my life.’ Three weeks after they married came the shattering diagnosis: Rosanna had advanced breast cancer. However she recovered and, despite being told Rosanna could never carry a child, they welcomed their 'miracle baby’ daughter Alessia on September 3, 2011. Rosanna was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer in June 2013 which was reportedly followed by brain cancer. At the time they ran the Snow Cloud Ski Lodge in the Woodridge section of Thredbo village together. The final sentences of Diver’s 2012 memoir is an ode to his wife: ‘Just look at what I now have … Alessia … Rosanna… my family… my career. 'Life’s good. All these things are evidence that something good can come out of something so bad.’ Friday's service will be held at a chapel in Thredbo and presided over by retired Salvation Army Lieutenant-Colonel Don Woodland.

        "input_text": "New surveillance footage of a Boston bomber laying an explosive then fleeing the scene has been shown in court. Footage shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking through the city before pausing near the finish line, where he dropped an explosive charge that killed an eight-year-old boy. He is seen standing in the crowd for several minutes, before calling his brother, Tamerlan. Shortly after the call, the first bomb explodes - at which point he pushes his way through the stunned crowd. Tsarnaev managed to clear the blast zone in the 12 seconds between the first bomb exploding and his going off - but is still in the shot from a surveillance camera at the scene. Shock: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, cirlced top left, is pictured above in FBI surveillance video standing in a crowd the moment the first bomb goes off at the Boston marathon. While most of the crowd looks towards the blast, he heads off in the other direction . Explosion: Pictured above is the moment Tsarnaev's pressure cooker bomb exploded. It killed two people and wounded dozens more . Killer: The blast ended the life of 8-year-old Martin Richard, and also robbed his sister of one of her legs . Some 12 seconds later, a second explosion takes place precisely where he was standing. He is later shown running from the scene without the backpack he was carrying earlier. It is unclear exactly how the bomb was detonated - though early claims that it primitive kitchen-timer device seem to be endorsed by the fact that Tsarnaev was still fleeing when the bomb went off. The blast killed eight-year-old Martin Richard, as well as Lingzi Lu, a 23-year-old student. Martin's younger sister, Jane, lost a leg in the blast and hundreds were injured. The footage was shown to jurors weighing up whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death for the bombing - which his lawyers do not deny he did. The video - nine and a half minutes in total - was compiled by FBI investigators from surveillance footage around the city. Plotting: Dzhokhar, circled in white, is pictured here before the blasts. His brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a gun battle days later, is circled in black . It shows both brothers walking the streets before splitting up to set down the pressure cooker bombs near the finish line on April 15, 2013. He is the only surviving bomber, as Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gun battle days after the attacks. Defense attorneys have argued that Tamerlan persuaded his brother to carry out the attacks, and as such he is not as culpable. Seconds later, the second bomb explodes, and Tsarnaev, who prosecutors say detonated the second bomb, is seen running with a crowd of people who also are running, pushing some out of his way to flee the scene. People are also shown jumping over metal barriers as smoke wafts over the scene. In wait: Tsarnaev is pictured above just down the street from the site of the bomb blast . Approaching: Tsarnaev, circled in white, is seen here walking up to the spot where he dropped the explosive . Less than 30 minutes later, Tsarnaev calmly walked into a Whole Foods store in Cambridge and bought a half-gallon of milk. Jurors were shown surveillance video of him making the purchase and then returning to the passenger side of a car parked in the lot. He then strangely runs back into the store to exchange the gallon of milk for another and then returns to the car. Tsarnaev's defense attorneys cross-examined a witness who said the time stamps on the Whole Foods CCTV was approximate, but prosecutors countered that with a receipt of Tsarnaev's purchase confirming the time for that day was correct. Prosecutors also showed jurors tweets from what they identified as two accounts of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 'If you have the knowledge and the inspiration all that's left is to take action,' he tweeted April 7, a little over a week before the bombings. 'I want the highest levels of Jannah,' he tweeted March 10, referring to the Islamic concept of paradise. 'I want to be able to see allah every single day for that is the best of pleasures.' After the blasts: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is seen entering a Whole Foods in Cambridge, Massachusetts just 30 minutes after the explosions . Errand: Surveillance footage from the Whole Foods shows the younger Tsarneav buying a carton of milk and then checking out . Not the driver: After leaving the store, Dzhokhar is seen walking in the parking lot and entering a waiting car through the passenger-side door . Wrong milk: Dzhokhar was seen re-entering the store to exchange the bottle of milk he purchased for another . Timing: Tsarnaev's lawyers cross-examined a witness who said the time stamps on the surveillance video were approximate, but Whole Foods provided a receipt for Tsarnaev that proves they were correct on that day . An exterior view of the Whole Foods in Cambridge, Massachusetts where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev bought a bottle of milk after the Boston Bombings . In January, three months before the bombings, he tweeted: 'I don't argue with folks who say islam is terrorism it's not worth a thing, let an idiot remain an idiot.' Jurors also heard from victims of the bombing. Jessica Kensky told how she and her husband, Patrick Downes, each lost a left leg in the 2013 attack. After more than 18 months of surgeries and consultations with doctors around the country, she came to the painful conclusion that her right leg would have to be amputated, too, she said. 'I did not want to become a bilateral amputee,' Kensky said. 'I wanted to paint my toenails, I wanted to put my feet in the sand, and I wanted to do all these things. To lose the second leg was a gut-wrenching, devastating decision.' On the run: This FBI video shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev fleeing the scene of the Boston bombing after setting his explosive. He was pictured carrying the backpack earlier in the day . Fleeing: Tsarnaev is pictured again, highlighted above, fleeing from the carnage he helped create . Facing death: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, is picturted above with a defense attorney in a court sketch from Monday 9 March. Federal prosecutors hope to secure the death penalty against him for his role in the bombings . Chilling: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev tweeted this message around two hours after he detonated the bomb . Also testifying Monday was a woman whose close friend, 23-year-old Lingzi Lu, died in the second bomb blast. Danling Zhou said Lu grabbed her arm after the first bomb exploded, looking panicked, and said 'What happened?' and 'What should we do?' Before Zhou could answer her, the second bomb exploded. Zhou said she looked in front of her and saw a man whose legs had been blown off. When she looked at Lu, she thought she would be OK because she seemed to still have her arms and legs, Zhou said. Trial: Tsarnaev's case is being heard at The John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston . She found out later in the hospital that Lu had died. Both women grew up in China and were graduate students at Boston University. Prosecutors say the Tsarnaevs carried out the bombing to retaliate against the U.S. for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During opening statements, a prosecutor cited a hand-scrawled note Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left on the walls of the boat he was captured hiding in and said he believed 'he was a solider in a holy war against Americans' and had 'taken a step toward reaching paradise.' Three people died and more than 260 were injured when two pressure-cooker bombs filled with shrapnel exploded near the finish line.",

        "input_text": "A young woman, who had no luck when she posted an ad on Gumtree to find the father of her unborn son, is determined to keep searching after her baby almost died at birth. Bianca Fazey had a one-night stand with a man in Perth, Western Australia on April 23 last year and surprisingly discovered she was pregnant after being told in 2011 that she was unlikely to ever become a mum when she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome. The 25-year-old frantically searched for the father for five months but had no success as she only knew his name was Jeremy who was from the Perth suburb of Morley. As a last-ditch attempt she decided to post the ad which only created unexpected vitriolic responses from total strangers. Two months ago, Logan Fazey was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him but now the little fella is fighting fit and healthy. Now that life has returned to normal after the trauma, the graphic design student has continued to look for Logan's father, a fly-in, fly-out worker in his 20s, who she met at the Harlem Wednesdays night at Amplifier Capitol. Scroll down for video . Bianca Fazey continues to  search for Logan's father who she had a one-night stand with in April last year . Two months ago, Logan was born, but he did not have an easy start to life when doctors worked for 30 minutes to resuscitate him - pictured is the first time Bianca got to touch her son . Now the little fella is fighting fit and Bianca described Logan as 'strong, smart, happy and very, very loved' Her latest appeal has seen social media users label Bianca as an unfit mother and accuse her of telling her story just for the money. 'I'm so appalled at comments that I am a bad mother and 'god help my child'. It makes me sick that people can judge so quickly off something that is 500 words long,' she said on her Facebook page. 'Yeah I am still looking, I will probably always be looking I am very curious as to who this person is and one day Logan probably will be too. 'I don't ever expect him to come forward but if he did contact me, it would only be between us two and not the world. ' Bianca then responded to the accusations that she was paid to do the media interviews. 'For the incredibly judgemental people thinking it is all about money, I have never accepted anything for the stories, I also have my own money, I work and I study full time, I am not this drop kick you assume me to be!' she said. 'I love this beautiful boy with all my heart and I am a fantastic mother, he is strong, smart, happy and very, very loved!' She then went onto express her gratitude for the ongoing support of her family and friends in the town of Jurien Bay - 260km north of Perth. 'Not only do I have the support of my family but also this beautiful town I live in and my amazing friends, I am so appreciative of everyone who has been kind to me even if you are holding your tongue!' she said. 'I don't know if this will be the end of this story, I will continue living my life and raising Logan just as I have been, in no way is getting 15 minutes of fame a priority on my list. 'Logan, my family, our health and happiness is all that matters to me.' Bianca Fazey posted a Gumtree ad last year in an attempt to find her unborn son's father . Bianca's ad (pictured) received a barrage of hateful remarks from complete strangers . When Bianca fell pregnant all she could think about was letting the pending father know the news. 'I was at my wits end,' she told Daily Mail Australia in December. 'I tried finding him for months and felt pressured by a friend who was adamant I don't give up despite exhausting all avenues.' This when Bianca, who was so stressed that she was losing sleep, decided to post an ad on Gumtree which created a barrage of hateful responses prompting her to take to take it down. 'I stupidly put it up thinking no one would even see it but who knows what will happen, maybe I will get lucky,' she said. 'Unfortunately all I got was lots of judgement and idiots messaging me telling me they would be the father or pretending to be Jeremy.' The most offensive messages were from people saying that Bianca should have opted for a termination. 'When it was shared on the LAD bible page a lot of people made single-minded comments aimed at me, no one mentioned the guy was equally a part of me getting pregnant,' she said. 'Sometimes I want to be like one of those people on Maury Povich screaming back at the audience because they have no clue what they're booing about!' Bianca was forced to take down the post but has no regrets about deciding to have the baby . Bianca (pictured before being pregnant) never thought she could have children as she suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome . Bianca wasn't exactly shocked to be called names like a 'sl**' but it got out of control when one person lashed out saying 'kill it'. 'It was sad to see people saying I should get an abortion, those were the only comments that hurt.' 'Society is still hating on women who choose to keep pregnancy outside of a relationship,' she said. 'I was more mad at the amount of women (mums included) saying I shouldn't go through with it.' But Bianca has risen above the horrendous backlash and can't wait to meet her little man when he enters the world in two months. 'All I can say is I chose to go ahead with the pregnancy because I didn't think I could have children,' she said. 'Even though I knew this guy had disappeared I didn't want to give up my chance and I'm so grateful I didn't.' Bianca has hit out at people saying she is a 'sl**', a bad mother and has only told her story for money . Despite the fall-out from the ad - Bianca has the loving support of the people who matter most - her family and friends. 'It has changed my life and made me a happier healthier person,' she said. 'I couldn't be happier, I am looking forward to holding my little guy and raising him in a loving stable environment.' She is also looking forward to getting back into shape . 'Excited to hold him and excited to start getting back in shape!' she said. 'I hate that I'm so limited physically.' Bianca still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of his son's life. 'I do hope that I can find him and let him know, he can make his own choice,' she said. 'But more for the sake of the kid, when he asks questions or wants to find him I want to be prepared.' She still hopes the father will come forward and become an integral part of Logan's life .",

The horrified reaction of a worker at the range who was supervising the man - identified as Liam Colven, originally from the Isle of Skye - can be seen as he wheels away in shock after trying to stop Mr Colven turning a handgun on himself. The footage was taken from a camera at the Thalang range on Phuket, Thailand, where the British man had arrived by taxi, reportedly following an argument with a male friend. When he hailed the taxi, he asked the driver to 'take me somewhere I can shoot', it was reported. A distressed staff member first tries to stop the man shooting himself, before wheeling away unable to believe what has just happened . Tragic: The man who shot himself has been identified as Liam Colven who was originally from the Isle of Skye . A Foreign Office spokesperson said it is 'urgently working with the authorities in Thailand to establish whether a British national has died in Phuket'. The 21-year-old used an 11mm pistol to shoot himself in the head. The incident happened at around 3pm local time when according to a staffer at the range, Mr Colven bought one package of six bullets and fired them all off at a target, reports the Phuket Gazette. He then asked for three more bullets before turning the gun on himself and firing at point blank range, staff and witnesses told police. Paying tribute to Mr Colven on Facebook last night, friend Alex Macleod said: 'There are no more words to sum up the events of today or to describe the loss and emotions of the people of Skye that has not all ready been said. 'However I consider myself lucky to be a part of a small community that I know will support the family in the days, weeks, & years to come. 'This wonderful community will also share in the loss and help each other to overcome it. RIP Liam Colven.' Jenny Mackenzie wrote: 'Love you Liam Colven sleep tight will cya one day mate x.' In the video of the incident, the staff member, wearing a light blue shirt, flings the sun hat he is wearing aside seconds after the shooting. Clearly in serious distress immediately following the man's actions, which apparently came without any sort of warning, he grips a table in shock before walking away with his hands on his head. Clearly in complete shock, the staff member who was supervising the man turns his face away in horror just seconds after he had tried to stop the British man from firing when he apparently turned the gun on himself . The man falls to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place . The member of staff then falls to the ground and strikes the floor in disbelief as he struggles to process what has just taken place. He looks back at where the tourist's body is lying slumped on the ground where he fell after discharging the weapon. Phuketwan reports that the British man called a taxi from a rank outside the Sun Wing Resort in Bang Tao to take him to the shooting range at around 2pm. The taxi driver who picked him up from a hotel at the beach resort, on Phuket's west coast, said the man was seen arguing with a friend before he picked him up. Prasert Pasaman, 41, said: 'I then asked him where he wanted to go, and he said \"take me somewhere I can shoot\" so I took him to the shooting range,' The Bangkok Post reported. But Mr Pasaman later told MailOnline that Mr Colven had not been involved in an argument, and had seemed 'happy' and 'normal' before the incident. Mr Pasaman said that he had seen Mr Colven speaking to another man outside the Sunkiss Hotel, but said they were not arguing. 'They talked for around half an hour. Not fighting just talking.' The taxi driver was sure the man had been Mr Colven's friend and not a hotel employee, and that Mr Colven was stopping by to see him. Despite not knowing for sure, he added: 'they looked like they knew each other' After that Mr Colven walked the short distance across the road and asked for a taxi. 'He said, \"I want to shoot\" so I took him there. The driver said there was 'some talk' during the drive but added that his 'English is not good' and the only thing he remembered was that he was 'from the UK'. Mr Colven was not staying in the premises himself, but it's believed he was visiting a friend before he went to the shooting range and shot himself dead. 'He was just sitting out the front for around a half an hour or an hour,' receptionist Jasmine Belarmino told MailOnline on Sunday. 'He look fine. He didn't seem sad or worried. He asked one of the employees about taxis. 'There are so many people through the hotel everyday and he didn't stand out to me. He was like anybody else.' A Thai policeman told MailOnline that Mr Colven had not been staying in the Ban Tao area prior to his death and that the young man's belongings had been collected by officers and taken to a the Thalang police station. He added that Mr Colven had been at the Sunkiss hotel to 'visit a friend'. A staffer at the Thalang shooting range said: 'He came by a taxi. He bought a ticket for shooting a .45 handgun and then then shot himself in the head.' The British tourist shot himself after emptying one magazine at a target, staff at the Thalang range said . MailOnline spoke to a young neighbour of the Thalang range deep in the Phuket countryside (pictured) Local officials have become increasingly concerned at the number of suicides among expats and tourists visiting Phuket. Pictured is Paradise Beach on the Thai island . A young man living near the shooting range, who did not want to give his name, told MailOnline: 'It is sad. I heard shots and someone scream. 'The police came and took his body away.' The range the 21-year-old visited is deep in the Phuket countryside, down a number of rocky byroads and around an hour from the bustling hub of Patong. The spot is peaceful  at night with plenty of trees around and a tied-up elephant grazing in front. Lt Kraisorn Boonprasop of the Thalang Police said: 'We have taken statements from some witnesses but we will question more people at the scene and we have yet to review the CCTV footage.'

Southeast Asia has an unfortunate reputation as somewhere where dangerous weapons can be fired for fun if you know the right people. There are also dozens of legitimate shooting ranges across the country offering tourists a wide array of guns to shoot. It may be  illegal for a foreigner to own or purchase firearms in Thailand, but you can fire handguns, rifles, shotguns and automatic weapons at these establishments. In Patong, around an hour from Thalang, the Shooting Café is located in the Jungceylon shopping mall and boasts on its website that it has an 'air-conditioned, full-service café wrapped around the shooting range. 'There’s a closed-circuit TV system inside too, so you can sit at the bar with a drink and watch shooters firing on all cylinders.' The Old City, known as Rattanakosin, is the epicentre of gun culture in the capital Bangkok. According to thailawforum: 'almost 80 gun and weapons shops line Wang Burapha Road. 'Shotguns and rifles stand upright in retail window displays next to arrays of handguns and ammo. 'For Thais looking to purchase guns, there’s no other place to go, though for foreign gun-enthusiasts, the most you can do is look.' If you're an expat resident or seasoned traveller in the region the chances are you know at least one person who has 'rented' weapons from enterprising military personnel.",

        "input_text": "President Barack Obama said Monday that American politicians in an era of partisanship should try to carry themselves more like Edward M. Kennedy. As politicians from both political parties lauded the late Massachusetts senator's collegial spirit at the dedication of an institute that bears his name, Obama said it was appropriate for Kennedy to want 'a monument not to himself but to what we the people have the power to do together.' The $79 million institute, built next to the John F. Kennedy presidential library on Boston's Columbia Point, was envisioned by Kennedy before he was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2008. He died the following year. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama, right, embraces Victoria Reggie Kennedy, widow of former U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy as she introduces Obama at the dedication ceremony for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, in Boston, Massachusetts . 'What if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy?' Obama asked during his speech. Obama praised Kennedy for looking for 'common ground' with his Republican colleagues . Obama shakes hands with former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, as Connecticut State Sen. Ted Kennedy Jr., watches during the opening of the $79 million institute that is located next door to the presidential library of Kennedy's brother, the late John F. Kennedy.

Jean Kennedy, center, is  flanked by Vice President Joe Biden, left, and former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy. Biden also spoke at the event, remarking that Kennedy 'treated me like a little brother' The president said today that he he hoped the institute could help restore confidence in government at a time of great cynicism, giving a young student a chance to debate in its full-scale replica of the Senate chamber. 'What if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy?' Obama asked. 'What if our politics, our democracy, were as elevated as he envisions it to be?' Obama said. Instead, the president said citizens are cynical about government and disgusted by politicians' trivial pursuits and grandstanding for 'cameras instead of colleagues.' Joan Kennedy, Ted Kennedy's first wife, stands up as she is recognized during the dedication ceremony . Journalist Maria Shriver, a niece of Ted Kennedy, was also on hand for the dedication (left). Michelle Obama was pictured by her husband's side during the ceremony (right) Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of John F. Kennedy - brother to Ted - and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, was also spotted in the crowd . Former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy, the son of Ted Kennedy, sits next to former presidential hopeful John McCain during the dedication ceremony . 'Fear so permeates our politics instead of hope. People fight to get in the Senate only to get afraid,' the president told some 1,800 Kennedy friends, family and politicians from both parties gathered for the dedication. He said Kennedy was never afraid to compromise with Republicans, even if it would anger his supporters. Speaker after speaker spoke of Kennedy's outsized influence on the Senate, where he served for 47 years, and held his consensus-building up in contrast to the gridlock that has become the hallmark of the modern Congress. 'No one made the Senate come alive like Ted Kennedy,' Obama said. 'It was one of the great pleasures of my life to hear Ted Kennedy deliver one of his stem winders on the Floor.' Then an Illinois senator, Obama served in the upper chamber with Kennedy for roughly three and a half years before vacating office in preparation for his move to the White House. Kennedy backed Obama for the Oval Office in 2008 over fellow senator Hillary Clinton of New York, comparing him in a speech to his brother John F. Kennedy, another young politician who ignored suggestions within the political class that he wait his turn in line and was successfully elected president. The influential senator died the following year in August of 2009 several months after Obama took office. Known as the 'Lion of the Senate,' Kennedy held his position as statesman in the U.S. Senate for nearly 50 years.

Kennedy III, Amy Kennedy and Patrick Kennedy . Patrick Kennedy, Amy Kennedy and her daughter Harper Petitgout are seen inside the debating hall at the new centre, which is a full-scale replica of the U.S. senate . Obama praised Kennedy on Monday for looking for 'common ground' with his Republican colleagues, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was on hand Monday for the event. It was 'common ground, not rooted in abstractions or stubborn, rigid ideologies, but shared experience, that led Ted and John McCain to work on a Patient’s Bill of Rights, and to work to forge a smarter, more just immigration system,' the president said. 'A common desire to fix what’s broken. A willingness to compromise in pursuit of a larger goal. A personal relationship that lets you fight like heck on one issue, and shake hands on the next -- not through just cajoling or horse-trading or serenades, but through Ted’s brand of friendship and kindness, and humor and grace.' McCain remembered Kennedy's 'zest for political argument' and said they would often laugh together after fighting on the Senate floor. He said the Senate hasn't been the same without him. ' That's mostly for reasons unrelated to losing Ted, but I have no doubt the place would be a little more productive and a lot more fun if he were there,' McCain added. Vice President Joe Biden said that Kennedy 'treated me like a little brother' when he arrived at the U.S. senate, and helped him into assignments usually not given to such junior politicians .

The afternoon included a performance by the Boston Pops Orchestra, as conductor Keith Lockhart (left) and Brian Stokes Mitchell (right) got into the swing of things . 'I miss fighting with him to be honest. It's gotten harder to find people who enjoy a good fight as much as Ted did,' he said to laughter. Vice President Joe Biden, who served with Kennedy in the Senate as well, said he 'treated me like a little brother.' When Biden first arrived in 1973, Kennedy helped him land choice committee assignments not generally available to freshmen senators. Biden said Kennedy introduced him around the Senate and was a master at generating trust and mutual respect. 'All politics is personal,' Biden said. 'No one in my life understood that better than Ted Kennedy.' Former Senate GOP Leader Trent Lott noted the irony of his inclusion on the institute's board of directors, along with former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle. 'Yes, a Republican from Mississippi,' said Lott, to laughter and applause, 'is proud to be here today.' Lott said although the two disagreed and had 'some fiery discussions,' they came together sometimes in a bipartisan way. Lott recalled after he worked with Kennedy on an immigration bill that lost on a procedural vote in 2007, he told him, 'Ted, every time I work with you I get in trouble man.' Trent Lott (centre, flanked by Tom Daschle, left, and Ted Kennedy Jr, right) gave an amusing speech in which he joked: 'Yes, a Republican from Mississippi, is proud to be here today' Ted Kennedy Jr, sentaor for Connecticut, speaks about his father at the opening of the Ted Kennedy centre .

Kennedy's widow, Victoria Kennedy, said her late husband hoped the institute would honor the nearly 2,000 who have served there and inspire future senators. She said he wanted visitors to feel the awe of walking into the chamber. Guests, including student groups, will be able to role-play as senators and debate some of the major issues of the day. The facility also includes a re-creation of Kennedy's Senate office, virtually unchanged from how it appeared when he died.

        "input_text": "A political operative has sued presidential campaign adviser David Axelrod over Axelrod's claim that he came up with the attack strategy that saved an embattled Philadelphia mayor in 2003. Philadelphia campaign consultant Frank Keel said it was his idea to blame Republicans for an FBI listening device found in Democratic Mayor John Street's office. Keel considers the decision to attack then-President George W. Bush's Republican administration 'a defining moment' of his career, according to his lawsuit. 'His brazen and successful handling of the crisis launched Keel to the forefront of his profession,' said the legal filing, filed earlier this week and first reported on by The Philadelphia Inquirer. In his book 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics,' Axelrod takes credit for the plan to accuse President George W. Bush's Justice Department of trying to sink Street's re-election bid. David Axelrod, Obama's senior campaign strategist in 2012, is under fire on at least two fronts for claims he made in his new political memoir . WHOSE IDEA WAS IT? Philadelphia Mayor John Street (right) swept to a re-election victory in 2003 after his campaign aides hatched a plot to blame Republicans for alistening device the FBI planted in his office . The FBI bugged Street's office as part of a 'pay-to-play' probe that led to the indictments of a city treasurer, a top Street fundraiser and 10 others. The mayor himself was never charged and denied wrongdoing. Street had initially been quiet about the bug found in his City Hall office but went on the attack as the campaign claimed that Republicans did it. Weeks later, he won re-election in a landslide. Axelrod, in a statement, said his book does not rule out the possibility that other advisers 'arrived at the same conclusion or proceeded on parallel tracks.' But the lawsuit claims Axelrod was unreachable on the day Keel came up with the strategy – and later opposed it. Shawn Fordham, Mayor Street's 2003 campaign manager, submitted a statement with the suit saying that Axelrod eventually 'got on board' and called Keel a 'hero.' Keel also sued Penguin Random House, Axelrod's publisher. It dismissed Keel's claims as 'utterly absurd.' Axelrod served as President Barack Obama's chief campaign strategist in 2008 and 2012. Now the founding director of the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, Axelrod cut his political teeth at age 27 as a city hall correspondent and columnist at the Chicago Tribune. Three years later he jumped to politics with a communications director job for sitting U.S. Senator Paul Simon. Mitt Romney's personal assistant Garrett Jackson (right) saw and heard everything the GOP candidate said and did during the last presidential race, and he said Axelrod lied about the 2012 Election Night concession call to make the Republican look like a race-obsessed sore loser . In addition to the Street campaign, Axelrod later managed the re-election campaign of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor, He later worked for then-Senator John Edwards' 2004 presidential campaign and latched on to Obama's 2008 effort. Ultimately he became one of the president's most senior advisers before departing the White House in 2011. His career has also included political consulting for liberal candidates in Canada and Italy. 'Believer: My Forty Years in Politics' came out in mid-February and has already brought complaints from two people who say Axelrod lied in the memoir . This year he's consulting with Britain's Labour Party in advance of May 7 elections. Labour has said Axelrod is being paid a 'six-figure salary' for his advice, and that he is working with Douglas Alexander, Labour’s shadow foreign secretary – largely via telephone conference calls. The Street case is the second claim that he lied in his memoir. The personal aide of one-time Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney blasted him last month for writing that Romney had claimed President Barack Obama's 2012 election victory was the product of an aggressive get-out-the-vote operation tageting blacks. Garrett Jackson told CBS News that Axelrod told a 'ridiculous ... lie' about a phone call between Obama and Romney on Election Night. The Republican nominee, according to Axelrod's account, angered Obama when he called to concede the race – saying, 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.' That's how Obama remembers it, Axelrod wrote. 'In other words, black people,' his book records the president as saying, 'That's what he (Romney) thinks this was all about.' Garrett claimed he was in the room listening to Romney's end of the conversation, and it never happened. Separately, Axelrod made news in February with a speech at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics by claiming that the Obama presidency has seen 'six years in which there hasn’t been a major scandal.' That claim drew a mix of applause and laughter from his audience.",
        "summary": "Axelrod took credit in his memoir for a plan blaming GOP dirty-tricksters for a listening device the FBI planted in a Philadelphia mayor's office as part of a criminal probe .\nBut another Democratic operative claims it was all his idea – and Axelrod thought it was a bad one .\nIt's the second time the Obama confidant's book has been branded dishonest .\nA Mitt Romney aide said last month that Axelrod lied when he wrote that the Republican candidate suggested on Election Night 2012 that Obama only won because his outreach targeted black voters .\nAxelrod has a long career in Democratic politics and landed a six-figure consulting contract with Britain's Labour Party during this year's elections ."

        "input_text": "Eric Joyce has racked up a £13,000 expenses bill on train tickets and hotel costs for staff – some of which was run up on a special Parliamentary credit card . Parliament’s expenses watchdog has been forced to dock an MP's wages until the election in a bid to recoup £13,000 in debts he owes the taxpayer, MailOnline can reveal. Eric Joyce, who was convicted of assault in 2012 after head-butting a fellow MP in a bar, racked up the bill on train tickets and other expenses – some of which was put on a special Parliamentary credit card. Commons expenses chiefs made the unprecedented decision to recoup the cash by deducting around £1,000 a month from Mr Joyce’s wages after he objected to handing back the cash. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority [IPSA], which overseas MPs’ expenses, began deducting cash from his salary in February, but he only has another two months’ pay before the election. Mr Joyce, who was kicked out of the Labour Party following the 2012 Commons brawl, is not standing for election in May and will therefore still owe thousands of pounds after leaving Parliament. IPSA has revealed that Mr Joyce now owes just over £10,000 - down from £12,919.61 at the end of January. If he refuses to repay the money after leaving Parliament he will be pursued through the civil courts, an IPSA source told MailOnline. The expenses body has never deducted cash directly from an MP’s salary before – and Mr Joyce is understood to be furious about the move. A source said: ‘We are doing it and he knows we are doing it. We have these powers to be able to do it. I wouldn’t say he was happy about it.’ IPSA informed the MP last month that they would not pay a host of travel and other expenses. A spokesman for the expenses watchdog said: ‘It is unusual for us to be in this situation, but we are clear that the MP has a duty to repay the sums due and it is our job to make sure that the taxpayer doesn’t lose out. ‘We are taking payments direct from the MP’s salary to recover the money due. If the MP leaves Parliament at the election and there are still amounts owing, we will continue to seek repayment.’ Mr Joyce, a former army officer, was thrown out of the Labour party after being arrested for head-butting Tory MP Stuart Andrew (right) in a House of Commons bar . Mr Joyce confirmed to MailOnline he owed around £10,000 in claims for ‘travel and accommodation for staff’. He revealed he was being docked ‘around a grand a month’ from his wages. Mr Joyce said he was told out of the blue by IPSA that he owed them the money and insisted that they had previously signed off his expenses claims – a claim which IPSA denies. The MP said he had made a complaint to the expenses watchdog’s compliance officer who was investigating whether it was a ‘fair demand’. He said: ‘It won’t be finished when I finish next month. I will have to pay them it anyway. ‘If I owe them it then I will pay them it, but I just dispute that I owe them it.’ In a blog post posted on his website last month he attacked IPSA for making it look like he ‘had knowingly left a debt unpaid for over a year’. Sir Ian Kennedy has led the clampdown on MPs' expenses as chair of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority . He said: ‘IPSA accepts that the claims were agreed in advance, then confirmed as OK, then checked and paid by IPSA.’ But he said: ‘They say that the original reading of the rules by IPSA staff was wrong and so was all of the advice they gave. ‘My staff member or me, as it’s my responsibility should therefore repay all of the cash paid out by IPSA last year.’ He added: ‘I have at no point in my parliamentary career failed to promptly pay anything to IPSA which may have been owed by my office, nor have I made any public complaint about IPSA. ‘I will not repay IPSA in cash unless the situation is resolved in IPSA’s favour.’ The revelation that Mr Joyce owes more than £10,000 to the Commons authorities comes after his expenses claims sparked controversy last year when it emerged he had bought expensive computers and charged them to the taxpayer. In total Mr Joyce claimed £185,635 in expenses last year. Among the items he charged to the taxpayer was £1,777 of 'replacement laptops' and £125 on accessories from the Apple shop. Mr Joyce will be able to keep the technology despite agreeing to refrain from seeking re-election in 2015. The MP was thrown out of the Labour party after being arrested for head-butting Tory MP Stuart Andrew in a House of Commons bar. In March 2013 the former Army major was banned from buying alcohol in Parliament following another bust-up. He was fined £1,500 for abusive language towards a baggage handler at Edinburgh Airport earlier this year. Mr Joyce has refused to resign his seat despite pressure from critics.",

        "input_text": "The cover for Harper Lee's new novel will surely remind you of the cover for her old one. On Wednesday, HarperCollins unveiled the jacket art for Lee's Go Set a Watchman, the unexpected follow-up to her classic To Kill a Mockingbird. The new cover, like the one for 1960's To Kill a Mockingbird, is a moody illustration featuring an oak tree in front. The art for Go Set a Watchman also shows train tracks and a train in the distance. In a statement released by HarperCollins, company President Michael Morrison noted that Go Set a Watchman begins with Mockingbird protagonist Scout Finch returning by train 20 years later, in the 1950s, to her native Alabama. Revealed: Publisher Harper Collins have released the official cover for Go Set a Watchman, set to be released July 14 (US jacket pictured left). It is the first novel from Pulitzer Prize-winner author Harper Lee since To Kill A Mockingbird in 1960 . HarperCollins has announced a first printing of two million copies and a July 14 publication date. However the release of the book has been mired with controversy since the publisher confirmed it in February. The announcement came just three months after the death of Lee's older sister, lawyer and gatekeeper, Alice Lee. Harper and Alice Lee lived together at a nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama. Alice was 103 when she died on November 17. Lee once described her sister Alice as 'Atticus in a skirt', referring to her beloved Mockingbird character Atticus Finch, which is believed to have originally been inspired by the women's father. Lee retreated into an intensely private life following the fame that To Kill A Mockingbird garnered her and repeatedly refused to publish another novel, maintaining her stance for over 50 years. Some in Monroeville subsequently question whether the 88-year-old was capable of now consenting to the second novel's publication. A longtime friend came forward claiming Lee is mostly deaf, blind and in poor health. Others questioned whether her mental health was sound enough to make such a decision. However, after launching an investigation, Alabama Securities Commission Director Joseph Borg said earlier this month his agency reviewed the matter at the Department of Human Resources' request, and that Lee answered questions to an investigator's satisfaction. They have since closed the case. Sameness: The cover for Lee's second book is much like her first, 1960's Pulitzer prize-winning piece To Kill A Mockingbird. Pictured right is the UK jacket of the upcoming book . A high-ranking state official said DHR opened its investigation after the second novel's announcement. The status of the DHR investigation was unclear. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The New York Times reported that investigators interviewed staff at The Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides, as well as friends and acquaintances. A doctor who asked to remain anonymous said he had filed a complaint after knowing Lee for two years and believing her infirm. Investigation: Earlier this month, staff at The Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides in Monroeville, Alabama, were interviewed to see if see was compos mentis . He said he had been told she was mostly incapable of communication. Such investigations can involve law enforcement if financial exploitation can be shown. One person speaking to The Times anonymously said Lee seemed to understand the investigators and give clear responses. People have argued for several different pictures of Lee: funny, depressed, witty, confused, or even varying from day to day. She reportedly had a stroke in 2007, resulting in health and vision problems. 'It's a call only God or a doctor can make,' attorney Philip Sanchez, who was a pallbearer for older sister Alice's funeral, told the Times. 'I am more concerned that Nelle is content than the discussion of her cognizance.' Accounts of Lee's mental and physical state have been contradictory over the last few years, but intensified recently after HarperCollins announced her second book, Go Set a Watchman . A friend of Lee, Wayne Flynt, said he visited her recently and found her mentally cogent. But he agreed she had some health issues, telling him 'I'm not so sure anymore', in response to a congratulations on the new book. Lee has only given statements about the novel through her attorney, Tonja B. Carter. Carter handled the book deal and declined to respond to interview requests. Lee wrote the book, Go Set A Watchman, in the 1950s. It was first submitted to publishers before To Kill A Mockingbird and is considered her earliest work. The manuscript was presumed lost, according to reports, but was found last year. It centers around Mockingbird's protagonist, Scout, returning to Maycomb after 20 years.",

        "input_text": "Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against the crazed activist they say slashed the U.S ambassador to South Korea while screaming demands for Korean reunification. The attack Thursday on Mark Lippert, which prompted rival North Korea to gloat about 'knife slashes of justice,' left deep gashes and damaged tendons and nerves. It also raised questions about security in a city normally seen as ultra-safe, despite regular threats of war from Pyongyang. While an extreme example, the attack is the latest act of political violence in a deeply divided country where some protesters portray their causes as matters of life and death. Scroll down for video . On the mend: U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Mark Lippert appeared on Thursday wrapped in a neck bandage  after a man attacked him with a knife during a lecture in Seoul . Suspect: Police are seeking an attempted murder charge against anti-U.S. activist Kim Ki-jong (above) who they say slashed the envoy while screaming demands for Korean reunification . Lippert, 42, was recovering well but still complaining of pain in the wound on his left wrist and a finger where doctors repaired nerve damage, Severance Hospital official Yoon Do-Heum said in televised briefing. Doctors will remove the 80 stiches on Lippert's face on Monday or Tuesday and expect him to be out of the hospital by Tuesday or Wednesday. Hospital officials say he may experience sensory problems in his left hand for several months. Police, meanwhile, searched the offices of the suspect, Kim Ki-jong for documents and computer files as they investigated how the attack was planned and whether others were involved . Dumbfounded: Kim was arrested in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Lippert on Thursday morning, which left the ambassador covered in blood . In custody: The 55-year-old Kim reportedly yelled 'North Korea and South Korea should be unified' before he attacked Ambassador Lippert at the breakfast meeting. Seen above being taken into custody on Thursday . Journalists question Kim, who was brought out in a wheelchair, as he left the police station for a court in Seoul earlier today . They want to charge Kim with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and business obstruction, and have requested a formal detention warrant. A further charge of violating South Korea's National Security Law, which bans South Koreans from publicly sympathising with the North Korean government, was being considered. But the 55-year-old has denied that he intended to kill Lippert. As part of their investigation they have also requested Kim's past travels to North Korea — seven times between 1999 and 2007 — during a previous era of inter-Korean cooperation, when Seoul was ruled by a liberal government. Kim attempted to build a memorial altar for former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il after his death in December 2011, police said. Protest: South Korean officials responded swiftly in response to the attacks, beefing up security outside the U.S. Embassy and promising justice. Above, a group of South Korean protesters burn North Korean flags in Seoul during a rally denouncing the attack on Thursday . Pro-American: While South Korea is one of America's strongest allies in Asia, there are factions of the country that are against the strong U.S. military presence. Above, more U.S.-South Korea alliance supporters pictured above on Thursday . Against the North: South Korean protesters shout slogans as they hold the photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, center and right, the late leaders Kim Jong Il, second from left, and Kim Il Sung, left, during a rally denouncing the attack on the U.S. ambassador on Thursday . Kim, who has a long history of anti-U.S. protests, said he acted alone in the attack on Lippert. He told police it was meant as a protest of annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that started Monday — exercises that the North has long maintained are preparations for an invasion. Kim said the drills, which Seoul and Washington say are purely defensive, ruined efforts for reconciliation between the Koreas, according to police officials. While most South Koreans look at the U.S. presence favorably, America infuriates some leftists because of its role in Korea's turbulent modern history. Washington, which backed the South during the 1950-53 Korean War against the communist North, still stations 28,500 troops here, and anti-U.S. activists see the annual military drills with Seoul as a major obstacle to their goal of a unified Korea. 'South and North Korea should be reunified,' Kim shouted as he slashed Lippert with a 10-inch knife, police and witnesses said. Right before: Lippert pictured above, seated at the breakfast table just prior to being attacked by Kim Thursday morning . Stained: Police say the ambassador was at his table and about to make a speech when Kim pushed him from behind and then started slashing him with a knife. Above, investigators survey the blood-spattered table on Thursday . Taken by surprise: Injured Ambassador Lippert is seen leaving the performing arts center where he was slashed by Kim Thursday morning . Stitched up: South Korean police stand guard outside Gangbuk Samsung hospital where Ambassador Lippert was taken after the attack on Thursday. Doctors say he needed 80 stitches for the wound on his face . South Korean protection: South Korean police patrol outside the U.S. Embassy in Seoul on March 5. The protection of foreign dignitaries and embassies is customarily the responsibility of the host country . Kim is well-known among police and activists as one of a hard-core group of protesters willing to use violence to highlight their causes. Police didn't consider the possibility that Kim, who has ties to the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation, which hosted the breakfast meeting where Lippert was attacked, would show up for the event, according to a Seoul police official who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. U.S. ambassadors have security details, but their size largely depends on the threat level of the post. Seoul is not considered to be a particularly high threat post despite its proximity to the North Korean border. It's not clear how many guards Lippert had, but they would have been fewer than the ambassadors in most of the Mideast. Outspoken: Kim Ki-jong reportedly has a history of public outbursts. Pictured above in an undated file photo from a prior protest . Seoul's Foreign Ministry said it was the first time a foreign ambassador stationed in modern South Korea had been injured in a violent attack. However, the Japanese ambassador narrowly escaped injury in 2010 when Kim threw a piece of concrete at him, according to police. Kim, who was protesting Japan's claim to small disputed islands that are occupied by South Korea, hit the ambassador's secretary instead, media reports said, and was sentenced to a three-year suspended prison term over the attack. The website of the Woorimadang activist group that Kim heads describes the group's long history of anti-U.S. protests. Photos show him and other activists rallying last week in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul to protest the U.S.-South Korean military drills, which are to run until the end of April. North Korea's state-controlled media crowed Thursday that Kim's 'knife slashes of justice' were 'a deserved punishment on war maniac U.S.' and reflected the South Korean people's protests against the U.S. for driving the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war because of the joint military drills. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia for meetings with regional leaders, said the U.S. 'will never be intimidated or deterred by threats or by anybody who harms any American diplomats.' Activists in Seoul, meanwhile, expressed worries that the attack on Lippert would harm the public image of peaceful protesters, or prompt the conservative government to suppress their activities. Small to medium-sized demonstrations regularly occur across Seoul, and most are peaceful. But scuffles with police do break out occasionally, and the burning of effigies of North Korean and Japanese leaders is also common. Some demonstrators have also severed their own fingers, thrown bodily fluids at embassies and tried to self-immolate. Lippert became ambassador last October and has been a regular presence on social media and in speeches and presentations during his time in Seoul. He's regularly seen walking his Basset Hound, Grigsby, near his residence, not far from where the attack happened. His wife gave birth here and the couple gave their son a Korean middle name. While South Korea is one of the U.S.'s closest Asian allies, America has been partially blamed for the severing of Korea into two countries. In 1910, the Japanese Empire took control of unified Korea which they ruled as a colony through the end of World War II. When the Empire fell IN 1945, it was decided in a United Nations agreement that Korea be split in half at the 38th parallel. The U.S. established a trusteeship in the south while the Soviets took over in the north, leading to the creation in 1948 of two separate countries. Above, American troops board a boat bound for South Korean at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 . However, both sides thought the situation was temporary that that their respective country would ultimately become the sole head of unified Korea. Cold War tensions between the U.S. and Soviet Union only fueled these ambitions, and in 1950 the North Korean army invaded the south backed by Chinese and Soviet soldiers. While the South Koreans nearly lost the war in just the first few months of battle, the U.S. helped booster their forces and retake their land. The fighting was disasterous for both countries, which eventually agreed to an armistance in July 1953. Since the Korean War is technically ongoing, the U.S. keeps troops in South Korea at the ready. However, the strong U.S. military presence in South Korean has led to negative sentiments from some citizens who oppose reliance on the West. Still, South Korea remains one of the most pro-American populations in the world. According to a 2013 poll, 77 per cent of South Koreans surveyed said they approved of President Obama's leadership - compared to just 45 per cent of Americans at the same time.",

        "input_text": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have been trying to paint him as a gullible teen who was recruited by his extremist brother to bomb the Boston Marathon finish line two years ago. But today, prosecutors presented the jury with a never-before-seen photo that tells quite a different story. Seen in the bedroom of his family home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sits at a computer chair and points to a black flag behind him - not unlike the kind used by extremist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. Tsarnaev's former best friend Stephen Silva testified in court on Tuesday that he saw the flag hanging in Dzhokhar's room, the one time he visited the apartment to watch The Walking Dead. Scroll down for video . Decoration: A new picture emerged of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in court on Tuesday, showing the accused Boston bomber posing underneath a black banner of Islam in the bedroom of his Cambridge family home . Silva was also the friend who lent Tsarnaev the gun used to shoot an MIT police officer in a confrontation a few days after the bombings. While the so-called Black Banner or Black Standard has been co-opted by Islamist extremist groups in recent years, it has much deeper origins in the Muslim world. The prophet Muhammed used a black standard when he fought, which is why it continues to be used as a symbol for modern-day jihadists. According to Boston University master Arabic lecturer Giselle Khoury, the flag reads: 'There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is Allah's Messenger'. She told the Boston Herald that the statement is called 'the shahada - the testimony' which declares one's belief in the Islamic faith. However, quickly after the picture of the flag was shown in court today, U.S. District Court Judge George A. O’Toole Jr ordered taken out of court since he found it 'illegible'. Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said another witness, who did not take the stand today, would be explaining the flag's significance further. Tsarnaev, 21, is charged with killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line on April 15, 2013, and shooting dead a university police officer three days later. Where the Boston Bombing was hatched: The jury deciding the federal death penalty trial were also shown other pictures from the Tsarnaev family home, including the image of the right of Dzhokhar's home computer . Authorities release this picture of the flag - which has become a symbol of Islamic terror groups the world over since the 1990s . Where he slept: Dzhokhar's former best friend Stephan Silva says they were friends for several years, but that he only visited the Tsarnaev house once to watch an episode of The Walking Dead on a computer from the top bunk of Dzhokhar's bunk-bed (above) Strict older brother: Silva told the court on Tuesday that he had never met his elder brother Tamerlan (left) and that Dzhokhar (right) described him as 'very strict, very opinionated' His former best friend Stephen Silva, who federal prosecutors contend loaned . Tsarnaev the gun used in the shooting, testified in court on Tuesday that he had long been close with the defendant but had never met his 26-year-old . brother, Tamerlan, who died following a gunfight with police . four days after the bombing. He said his brother was very strict, very opinionated, and . that since I wasn't a Muslim he might give me a little s*** for . that,' Silva said.

Prosecutors called Silva, 21, to the witness stand to . discuss the loan of the rusty Ruger P95 handgun they contend was . used to shoot dead Massachusetts Institute of Technology police . officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013. Silva has pleaded guilty to federal gun and drug charges, . but was offered leniency in exchange for his testimony. He . testified he had gotten the gun from a friend, intending to use . it to protect his drug business, and also used it in a robbery. Tsarnaev asked to borrow it, saying he too was interested in . committing a robbery, Silva testified. On loan: The gun was part of evidence shown in court on Tuesday. Friend of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Stephen Silva,  allegedly gave him the weapon which was used to kill MIT officer Sean Collier . Ruined: This smashed-up iPhone was found at the scene of a shootout between the Tsarnaev brothers and police in the suburb of Watertown on April 18 - a few days after the bombings . In the most aggressive cross-examination by the defense in . eight days of testimony, Silva acknowledged having posted on . Facebook and having told the FBI that he believed the bombing must have been Tamerlan's idea. 'At the time that's what I felt, yes,' Silva said in . response to questioning by defense attorney Miriam Conrad. He also acknowledged having told prosecutors in August he . used 'peer pressure' to persuade Dzhokhar to smoke marijuana, . which Silva sold. 'That's what I said but I stated it wrong,' Silva said on . Tuesday. Emerging: Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, bloody and disheveled with the red dot of a sniper's rifle laser sight on his head, emerges from a boat at the time of his capture by law enforcement authorities in Watertown, Massachusetts on April 19, 2013 . Hide-out: In this courtroom sketch, the boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured was depicted on a trailer for observation during Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial on Monday . In court: In this courtroom sketch, Tsarnaev, center seated, is depicted between defense attorneys while the boat in which he was captured in sits on a trailer for observation during his federal death penalty trial on Monday . Message: Inside the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hid for hours before he was captured by police, he carved on wood panels the phrase: 'Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop' Inscription: Another picture of the wood panels taken from inside Henneberry's boat . Silva also testified that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had once called . him a 'kafir,' an Arabic word meaning non-believer or infidel, . in response to Silva calling the defendant a 'Russian refugee'. Tsarnaev is an ethnic Chechen whose family moved to the . U.S. a decade before the attack. Other than the 'kafir' incident, Silva said Tsarnaev had . rarely talked about religion. Also on Tuesday, the owner of the boat where Tsarnaev hid . after a gunfight with police recalled stepping into his backyard . after a day-long lock down was lifted and finding a person in his . watercraft. David Henneberry described waking up the morning after a . gunfight between the Tsarnaev brothers and police rocked his . suburban neighborhood and noticing something wrong about the . winter covering of his boat, but presuming it had been blown . around by the wind. He put off checking it until after authorities had lifted a . shelter-in-place order on Boston-area residents four days after . the bombing, WBZ reported. 'I went to check on the boat and basically see why the strap . was loose and I noticed a lot of blood,' Henneberry said. 'I . just kept fixating on this blood and then, I just, my eyes . looked at the other side of the boat and that's when I saw a . body in the boat ... I got off the ladder pretty quick and went . in the house.' When prosecutors wrap up their case it will be the defense's . turn to call witnesses, who could include Tsarnaev. After that, . the jury will consider Tsarnaev's guilt. If he is found guilty, . a second phase will play out that will focus on sentencing. The bombing killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, . graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard. Henneberry said after he called 911, bringing dozens of . heavily armed police who fired scores of rounds into the boat . where Tsarnaev was discovered. The jury also saw two wooden slats from the boat into which . a message had been carved which read: 'Stop killing our innocent . people and we will stop.' On cross-examination, Mr Henneberry was asked by the defense if the blood and bullet holes in his boat were there before April 19. He confirmed that they were not. Final words: Inside the boat, Tsarnaev wrote a series of notes, which the jury saw on Monday. This note, punctured with bullets, explains how he is jealous of his brother Tamerlan because he had died and gone to paradise . The notes also denounced the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Last week, the jury heard how all the bullets that made holes in the side of the boat were shot from outside the vessel as he hid inside . Investigators on a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts the day after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding inside in April 2013. On Monday, the jury in his death penalty trial visited the boat .",

Rodner Figueroa, who's known for his biting fashion commentary, made the racially insensitive remark on the entertainment news show El Gordo Y La Flaca on Wednesday. Venezuelan-born Figueroa made the remark in a segment discussing the work of make-up artist Paolo Ballesteros who posts photos of himself transformed into female celebrities. Rodner Figueroa has been fired by the Spanish-language TV station Univision after he compared the First Lady to a character from Planet Of The Apes on live television . Rodner Figueroa, left, made the racially insensitive remark on the entertainment news show El Gordo Y La Flaca on Wednesday . Figueroa, 42, was talking about how Ballesteros had transformed himself into the First Lady when said: 'Well, watch out, you know that Michelle Obama looks like she's from the cast of Planet Of The Apes, the movie.' When hostess Lili Estefan countered with 'What are you saying?' and host Raul de Molina said Obama was very attractive, Figueroa defended his remark, saying 'but it is true.' The show aired live on the East Coast, but his remarks were edited out of the version broadcast for the West Coast, reports Latino Voices. Later Figueroa co-hosted the evening gossip show Sal Y Pimienta, but by Wednesday night his photo had already been removed from the network's website. In a statement on Thursday, Univision called Figueroa's comments 'completely reprehensible' and said they 'in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision.' 'Yesterday during the entertainment show El Gordo y La Flaca, Rodner Figueroa made comments about First Lady Michelle Obama that were completely reprehensible and in no way reflect the values or opinions of Univision. 'As a result, Mr. Figueroa was fired immediately,' read the statement. Venezuelan-born Figueroa made the remark in a segment discussing the work of make-up artist Paolo Ballesteros who posts photos of himself transformed into female celebrities such as the First Lady . On Thursday he issued an open letter apology to Michelle Obama. In it he claimed his comments were taken out of context and that as a member of a 'bi-racial Latin family' he isn't a racist, reports Latin Times. 'I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years,' he said. 'I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino. I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that is openly gay and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities, that have been discriminated against just like me.' Figueroa had won the award for Outstanding Daytime Talent in the Spanish category at the Daytime Emmy Awards last June. Univision is the largest Spanish-language network in the United States, reaching an estimated 94 million U.S. homes. It ranks fifth among all television networks in the U.S. Figueroa, who won the Outstanding Daytime Talent in Spanish category at the Daytime Emmy Awards last June, issued an apology on Thursday . Dear First Lady Michelle Obama, . I offer my sincerest apologies for a comment that I made about the characterization from a make-up artist that I made about you in the Univision entertainment program El Gordo y La Flaca. I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and it was directed personally to you, but to the characterization of the artist, that left a lot to be desired. The clip in full context is proof. I feel embarrased, I ask for forgiveness, because there is no excuse for a professional like me to make those types of comments that can be interpreted as offensive and racist in a volatile moment that we live in our country. I take responsibility for this lack of judgement in my part, but I can't accept that I am being called a racist and being fired for that reason and being humiliated by Univision after working there for 17 years. I come from a bi-racial Latin family, with family members, like my father, who is Afro-Latino. I am the first presenter on Hispanic TV that is openly gay and I am an activist for causes that favor minorities, that have been discriminated against just like me. I openly voted twice for your husband Barack Obama, because I consider him a great man that respects minorities, like me, in this country. I worked on two Univision shows where I commented about celebrity style, including the real family and Latin first ladies and I have never offended anybody because of their skin color, sexual orientation or nationality. I am a decent person, but a human in the end that makes mistakes like this one. Although the comment was unpleasant and out of line I do not deserved being called a racist and I have to defend myself for respect and love to my family, my father, my fans and my community. I was notified verbally that due to a complaint from your office I was fired. An information leak from Univision executives, I was condemend in social media, trying to destroy my career in an unfair manner, without letting me know personally and without an investigation that would allow to clear up the situation. Again, I offer my humble forgiveness for the misinterpreation and I assume the responsibility. Yours respectfully, . Rodner Figueroa .",

Asked if there was any 'truth' to rumors that the 'Obamas are behind this purchase' White House spokesman Josh Earnest smirked and said, 'They are not.' An attorney for Marty Nesbitt, a close friend of the president and first lady from their days in Chicago, said Thursday that his client bought the property. The lawyer, Seth Madorsky, said Nesbitt didn't have any partners or co-investors in the deal. These undated photos, provided by LIST Sotheby's International Realty, show the Waimanalo, Hawaii, home used for the filming of the 1980s television show 'Magnum, P.I.' The 3-acre oceanfront property has sold for $8.7 million to a close friend of President Barack Obama . The first family is not the true purchaser of the sprawling beachfront home, the White House said on Friday. The 3-acre oceanfront property is in Waimanalo, next to the town of Kailua where the Obama family has spent the winter holidays in recent years . Known as 'Pahonu,' the property has been owned by single family since its construction before its recent sale .

The 3-acre oceanfront property is in Waimanalo, next to the town of Kailua where the Obama family has spent the winter holidays in recent years. That it's close to an Air Force base and has a maid's house that could house security officers - a Secret Service requirement - had Fox News speculating on Friday afternoon that the Obamas might be the intended, future occupants of the abode. Tom Selleck's character, Robin Masters, lived in the house on Magnum P.I. It was known as 'Robin's Nest' on the show. Many of the scenes from the show were not actually taped at the residence, however, and were instead shot in a studio. According to real estate website Zillow, the Spanish Colonial style residence was built in 1933. Known as 'Pahonu,' the property has been owned by single family since its construction before its recent sale. In addition to a five-bedroom and 5.5 bath 11,054 square foot main residence, Zillow states that the property features a 'historic turtle pond,' tennis courts, a gate house, boat house, four-car carriage house and a bath house. 'A truly rare and lifetime opportunity,' the listing states. It also accesses a private beach. The Obamas still own a home on the South Side of Chicago, but they rarely visit it anymore. Instead, they spend their winter vacations in Hawaii, the president's birth state. The president is pictured here in December of 2011 with daughters Malia, left, and Sasha, right, as well as Nesbitt, back right, after a visit to Sea Life Park - which is located right next to the Pahonu property Nesbitt just purchased . That it's close to an Air Force base and has a maid's house that could house security officers - a Secret Service requirement - prompted speculation that the Obamas might be the intended future occupants of thehouse . Manicured: The house is set in extensive and well-maintained grounds - which the White House said the Obamas would not be enjoying . Nesbitt is a Chicago businessman who served as treasurer for Obama's first presidential run. He is the chairman of the Barack Obama Foundation, which will build the president's future library. He remains one of the first family's closest friends, and is one of Obama's most frequent golf partners. The two have played together 18 times since the former Illinois senator moved into the White House, according to Politico, including several times in Hawaii. The Obamas still own a home on the South Side of Chicago, but they rarely visit it. Instead, they spend their winter vacations in Hawaii, the president's birth state. Their favorite restaurant, the critically acclaimed Alan Wong's, is also located in the Hawaiian islands. Meals there cost $75 a person. The cost rises to $105 each when paired with wine. As Politico notes, it wouldn't be unprecedented for the Obamas to purchase a new home through a family friend and allow it to lay in wait while still living at the White House. George W. Bush and Laura Bush acquired their Dallas, Texas, home in the name of the then-president’s personal accountant, Robert McCleskey. McCleskey came up with the funds by taking out a loan from a Midland, Texas, bank. But the Bushes didn't deny that they'd purchased, accommodations, though they wouldn't say where, and they waited until the final months of the 43rd president's tenure to to attain the property. Barack Obama has just over 21 months left in his presidency. While the Obamas don't currently have the estimated net worth necessary to make such a purchase, as their assets are currently valued at a maximum of $12 million and still have two children to put through college, they could easily raise the additional funds after leaving the White House through speaking fees and book advances, much like the Clintons. The former president and first lady, who is now considering a presidential bid of her own, alternate between homes in Washington, D.C. and Chappaqua, New York. In addition to a five-bedroom and 5.5 bath, 11,054 square foot main residence, the property features a 'historic turtle pond,' tennis courts, a gate house, boat house, four-car carriage house and a bath house.

James Ben Canaan walked out on the Gloriavale Christian Community, located in Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast, suddenly at the weekend with his wife Hope and 12 children. The commune, who refused to go into detail about the Ben Canaan family's sudden departure, hit back at the family's accusations arguing that it was 'entirely their choice to leave', the New Zealand Herald reports. Scroll down for video . Children dressed in Cooperite clothing walk at Gloriavale Christian Community located at Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast . Children at the school in Gloriavale Christian Community. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members . 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here,' Fervent Stedfast, a Gloriavale member since 1970, said. 'We're here simply and entirely because we want to be here.' It comes as the daughter of Gloriavale's leader, Neville Cooper, spoke out for the first time since leaving the remote community about her struggles to reintegrate in the 'outside world'. Miracle left the cult, which forces people to wear the same uniform and bans birth control, five years ago with her husband and 10 children, 3News reports. Miracle said there was no doubt the Ben Canaan family would struggle like she did to integrate into society. 'Making a decision to come on the outside you leave with basically the clothes on your back,' she said. 'I think the biggest struggle is at our age - I was 45 - and to start life from scratch, normally you would have built up a life from a young age. 'The struggle is just so hard. 'You don’t know any obligations to renting a home, opening bank accounts. You don’t even have a birth certificate or driver’s licence – or any identity to even be able to do those things.' The Ben Canaan family, who are among a number of large families to walk out on Gloriavale in recent years, are now staying 300km away in Timaru.

James and Hope Ben Canaan have since forsaken their nun-like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes, while their children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms. 'It's a huge deal for them to stop wearing their community clothes and so they are going to transition slowly,' Liz Gregory, who has offered the family of 14 her home, told the New Zealand Herald on Wednesday. The father, who managed the commune's self-sufficient dairy farm for 20 years, is now looking for a job. Ms Gregory said the family had 'come to believe they were in a false system and left 500 of their family and friends (the only ones they've every known).' 'They are hugely courageous…they are very excited about starting life out here,' she said. 'They are feeling blessed, but are aware of the road ahead of them.' Ms Gregory told the Herald that the family, who do not want to make any public comment, was in great spirits 'which is incredible, because what they have done (walking out) is massive.' Gloriavale, which was established about 45 years ago, does not condone the use of birth control and it is common for a married couple to have 12 or more children. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members, is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian'. But it has been revealed that he was convicted of sexual abuse in 1994 and spent 11 months in jail.

The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control. One young couple were married after just six weeks of courtship. Their website states the couple 'make vows to God and each other before the Church, for no preacher can 'marry' them'. The marriage procedure is as follows: 'Then they go to a private place pleasantly prepared for love-making. As they consummate their marriage before God, He joins them together in a bond that only death can break.' 'They return as a married couple to a wedding feast with the rest of the Church.' The cult has several sources of income which includes dairy farming and deer farming.

Tina McKinnon, 45, was taken into custody in Linn, Wisconsin early on Thursday. She faces charges of felony aggravated animal cruelty and misdemeanor cruel treatment to animals. This type of felony is typically punishable with probation or up to three years in prison, Sheriff's Lt. Richard Roodhouse said. The shocking discovery was made by Cole Eshleman, the property's owner, who heard barking while working in a machine shed at 1358 Heitter Road. More than 30 dogs ran out when he opened the door. He said McKinnon had only moved in after Christmas. 150 animals were rescued from the rural Illinois property - sadly 65 were already dead . Tina McKinnon, 45, was taken into custody in Linn, Wisconsin early on Thursday. She had reportedly only moved into the house just after Christmas . The house at 1358 Heitter Road outside Freeport, Illinois will likely have to have its floors ripped out. Dogs were found in closets, crates, the stove and inside duct work . Animal control warden Kristin Laue said the dogs had been given free rein in the house. 'There were feces all over the house, urine, of course, dogs everywhere: dogs in closets, dogs in the stove, in the duct work,' Laue told The Journal Standard. Some dogs had been confined to crates. A search warrant was obtained and animal control authorities, Friends Forever Humane Society and a private citizen rounded up the dogs, a process that took almost five hours. They counted 29 dead cats and 36 dead dogs. 'I don't think that person lived in the house. I think that person supposedly lived in a car,' Stepheson County Assistant State's Attorney, Joe Lentz, told ABC 17 Eyewitness News. Stephenson County Animal Control received a call  that a pack of dogs was running down Heitter Road. 'Just a whole lot of dogs ... like 40 dogs running along the road,' Lentz said. He added that the dogs kept running back to the home, which is how animal control knew they had the correct location. Kristin Laue comforts a female pit bull-mix at the Freeport Animal Hospital on Wednesday. The dog had multiple injuries and scars . A terrier-mix waits for additional treatment. It took almost five hours to round up all of the dogs. When they were discovered as many as 40 ran out of the front door of the home . They got a search warrant to enter the home and discovered all the animals inside. 'Some animals... couldn't be removed I guess. They were kind of like stuck to the floor and stuff like that. And, some puppies were in an oven, just for protection, apparently,' said Lentz. Mackinnon had contacted animal control and an animal rescue organization in recent weeks, and she told them she was a rescuer and needed help, Laue said. The woman gave away a few animals but didn't hold up her end of other agreements and did not give an address. 'We tried to help her, but she never took us up on it,' Laue said. 'It was just a matter of time before something happened where we found out where she was.' The dogs ranged in age from young puppies to adults, likely 10 to 12 years old, Laue said. Sixty-one dogs are being held temporarily at Freeport Animal Hospital, where Laue works, and the rest have been dispersed to area shelters. Many of the smaller dogs are sociable and appear to be in good health, but have parasites and skin conditions associated with contact with feces. Laue holds two female Chihuahuas rescued from the property. Many of the smaller animals are sociable and appear to be in good health . Donations are being accepted at the animal hospital, including small towels and rags, newspapers, dog food and dish soap. Stephenson County, Illlinois Sheriff's Department officials say they are coordinating with Walworth County, Wisconsin officers for McKinnon's extradition. Eshleman said that he didn't yet have a damage estimate for his property, but he anticipated having to cut out and replace the flooring throughout the house. McKinnon told him she cleaned homes and had two dogs, Eshleman said, and Laue believes she had previously lived in Texas and Wisconsin. McKinnon has been in trouble for having too many dogs before according to authorities. She was kicked out of a Whiteside County apartment for having too many dogs and fined in Winnebago County in 2013 for having 22 dogs, four of which were not vaccinated.

        "input_text": "For most of her life young Queensland woman Samantha Geldenhuys thought she was an ordinary Australian girl with a loving mum and younger brother living in a beachside suburb of Townsville. Then the Australian Federal Police came knocking on the door of the family home and arrested Sam's mother. That was when the pretty young blonde learned she was the subject of one of America’s longest running child kidnapping cases, and that her mother's real name was Dorothy Barnett and that she was an international fugitive wanted by US federal authorities. And that over in South Carolina a wealthy stockbroker by the name of Benjamin Harris Todd III had never given up hope of finding her - and that Sam's birth name was Savanna Todd. 'She just took me and ran,' Sam told Channel Seven. 'She started anew just for me.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Confused: For 20 years Samantha Geldenhuys (pictured) thought she was an ordinary young woman, but then police came and arrested her mother at their Townsville home and Sam learned she was the centre of America’s longest running child kidnapping case and her Mum was an international fugitive . Never gave up hope: Savanna's father Benjamin Todd II (pictured with his baby daughter in 1994) never stopped hoping his kidnapped daughter would be found and each year updated her room and made a video for each of her birthdays . Dorothy Lee Barnett pictured with baby Savanna kidnapped her daughter after a bitter custody battle and absconded to South Africa and eventually Australia where she lived as a fugitive under an assumed name until her lie unravelled following a slip of the tongue while drinking with friends . The only father she knew: Savanna, pictured as a toddler, was renamed Samantha. She is in the arms of the man she thought was her father, her stepfather, Juan Geldenhuys, who later died before Samantha learned the incredible truth about her past . Another life: Samantha pictured with the mother she knew as Alex Geldenhuys, whose real name was revealed as Dorothy Barnett following her dramatic arrest in Queensland last year and deportation back to a US Jail . It was a lot to take in the blur that followed. Sam's mother made several appearances during extradition hearings in a Queensland court before Ms Barnett was finally deported to the US and immediately placed in prison. Channel Seven's Sunday Night programme accompanied Ms Geldenhuys to the US for a tearful reunion with her mother and to attend 53-year-old Ms Barnett's trial on Parental Kidnapping and US Passport Fraud charges, for which she is now serving prison time. The dramatic events of Sam's past began on an access visit in 1994, when Dorothy Barnett did not return baby Savanna to Benjamin Todd and the two disappeared. Samantha and her real father Benjamin Todd III pictured together just months before Savanna disappeared. Following her parents' separation her father was awarded full custody of Savanna . A still from footage of baby Savanna before her kidnapping by her mother, who was only allowed supervised acess to her daughter after a court case in which Benjamin Todd III alleged Barnett was bipolar . Samantha and her mother not long after fleeing. Todd and Barnett had been engaged in a bitter custody battle, but each side has different reasons for the failure of their doomed relationship . Savanna now named Samantha with stepfather Juan and mother Dorothy, now known as Alex, in South Africa . A young Samantha who insists she had a loving, stable upbringing and that her mother was nothing but loving, doting on herself and her younger half-brother, who's father is Samantha's late stepfather Juan . Samantha last year after learning the truth about her past . Todd and Barnett had been engaged in a bitter custody battle, but each side has different reasons for the failure of their doomed relationship. Benjamin Todd II was a softly spoken 'southern gentleman' and classical music lover, the son of a nurse and a doctor from Kentucky who entered a career working at financial management company Merrill Lynch in Charleston, South Carolina. Dorothy Lee Barnett, had been raised by a single mother and stepfather on welfare, and had travelled extensively, running a piggery in Belize, a jewellery business in Africa, before finally settling for a job as a flight attendant. Savanna Todd as a baby with her mother Dorothy before Ms Barnett fled overseas and began living life under the radar until her arrest in Townsville last year . Loving relationship: Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and had a son . When the pair met, and married after a whirlwind romance, Dorothy became pregnant with her daughter. Dorothy Barnett's friends told the Seven Network that Benjamin Todd had wanted Barnett to terminate her pregnancy with Savanna in 1993. But when the marriage failed, it was Todd who gained custody of Savanna following a court case in which he alleged Barnett was bipolar, and she was awarded only supervised access to her baby daughter. It was on one of these visits Barnett and 11-month-old Savanna disappeared and embarked on their lives as fugitives, travelling to Malaysia, Singapore, and South Africa where Barnett married Juan Geldenhuys and they had a son. Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said . Nervous: Benjamind Todd II (left on television during the years he searched for his daughter) and (right) last year after learning his 20 year wait had come to an end, but at a time when he was still unsure whether Savanna/Samantha would want to meet him . The couple emigrated to New Zealand, where they gained citizenship, and then Barnett and her children moved to Australia's Sunshine Coast, where they were known as Alexandria, Samantha and Rhys Geldenhuys. It was over evening drinks after a day's sailing in 2011 that 'Alex Geldenhuys' slipped up. Ms Barnett referred to Samantha as 'Savanna' and said she had fled an 'abusive' relationship in America. Barnett's South African friends went online and found a page on the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children's website. They saw pictures of a woman who looked like a younger 'Alex' and an age-advanced photo of a girl who resembled Samantha. They contacted Benjamin Todd III  in America. His long hunt for Savanna was over. Tearful reunion: Samantha speaks on a phone to her mother inside the South Carolina prison where Dorothy Barnett is serving time for her kidnap and passport fraud offences . Dorothy Barnett cries as she speaks with her daughter in the prison where she is serving 21 months after being deported and pleading guilty to kidnapping her own child from the US in 1994 . As Mr Todd's lawyer, J Graham Sturgis told Channel Seven, Benjamin Todd 'never quit' looking for his daughter. 'For years he updated her room to be age appropriate and would record a video message to her on her birthdays,' Mr Sturgis said. 'It is a parent's worst nightmare not to know what happened to a child [but] he never lost hope and pursued every possibility that might lead to her recovery.' However, friends of Ms Barnett described Todd as an 'evil, evil man' while Barnett herself described his pursuit of her as 'corrupt' and 'criminal'. Whatever is the truth, the extraordinary story of how Ms Barnett eluded the FBI for two decades, and how her life as a lie unravelled, is said to have 'deeply confused' 21-year-old Samantha. Channel Seven filmed her as she reunited with Ms Barnett in the South Carolina prison where she is serving a 21 month sentence after pleading guilty to one count of International Parental Kidnapping and two counts of False Statement in a Passport Application. Ms Barnett will be required to undergo two years’ supervised parole following her release. While Channel Seven has not yet revealed whether Samantha finally meets her real father, there has been emotions running high on both sides. 'His daughter thus far has been reluctant to meet,' J Graham Sturgis, told Daily Mail Australia. 'She only knows her mother and the misinformation that has been provided her. She likely would be considered by her mother to be disloyal if she were to meet [Todd] at this time.' Mr Sturgis said the intensely private stockbroker understood why the daughter snatched from him and who never knew him as father had  held off from speaking with him, and that he feared jeopardising his hoped-for reunion with her. But Mr Sturgis said Todd yearned for the 'long awaited opportunity' of meeting Savanna and had literally counted the days - 19 years, six months and 12 days - from the access visit on which Savanna disappeared  to when Australian police knocked on a door in faraway Townsville and his long lost daughter was found. This episode of Sunday Night hosted by Chris Bath airs on Sunday, March 5 at 7pm on the Seven Network.",

Ashley Summers of Cleveland, Ohio is believed to have been spotted in video footage taken from a bank ATM in Warwick, Rhode Island this January, eight years after the 14-year-old first was reported as missing. This as the FBI has revealed she may be wanted in connection with check theft and identity fraud in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . Ashley Summers may have been spotted in Rhode Island (above) eight years after she disappeared from Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 14 . Summers is seen at 14-years-old (left) and in an age progression photo at 20-years-old (right) This is the car the woman believed to be Summers was spotted in at a bank in Rhode Island . NBC News reports that Summers' step-grandmother Linda stumbled across the photo when the FBI posted it online looking for information about the woman, at which point she immediately sent photos of Summers to the Warwick Police Department as they searched for leads in locating the woman. When that did not work, the FBI stepped in to launch a wider search, even posting billboards along the East Coast. Despite the young woman's possible criminal activity, this would be amazing news for the family as some believed Summers may have been a victim of Ariel Castro, the Cleveland kidnapper who held three woman against their will in his House of Horrors for years. Michelle Knight, one of the victims, said upon her release that she remembered another girl being at the house at some point around the time Summers first disappeared on July 6, 2007. Knight said the victim disappeared shortly after. Authorities immediately believed the girl could have been Summers as she lived in the same neighborhood as Castro. It was thought by some that she may have been kidnapped by Ariel Castro and kept at his House of Horrors (above), which was in her Cleveland neighborhood . Summers' mother, Jennifer, has always been firm in her belief that her daughter was taken against her will and would never have run off from home on her own. Summers was living with an uncle at the time of his disappearance, arguing with the man shortly before she vanished. She may have called her mother a year later, who claims she received a call from a woman who said; 'It's me mom. Dont worry.' And as the FBI calls on the public to help locate this woman, Summers' mother is hoping she will finally be able to see her daughter again after all these years and 'erase the pain' she has felt since that day in 2007. 'There's nothing that tells us that it is her, but there's nothing telling us that it's not her either,' said FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson. Anyone with any information is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).",

Two of the final three clutches of the eggs have already hatched this week with the third in the process of producing the last of the seriously cute critters.

        "input_text": "A woman has been left ‘gobsmacked’ after a camera, packed with memories of her once in a lifetime trip to Antarctica, is on its way back to her after she lost it three months ago on a snowy iceberg. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to the remote region costing around $13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip. She’d loaded her iPad up with episodes of American comedian Ellen DeGeneres’s chat show to entertain her while travelling to Antarctica and had been watching a Robin Williams episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera. ‘We spent an open night on an iceberg, the only thing around us were penguins and seals lazing around. I took the camera out of my pocket and said “everyone let’s do a very Merry Christmas from Antarctica to Ellen because she’s entertaining us at the bottom of the earth”,’ Ms Boz explained. 'Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera!': This is the distinctive photo that helped tour operator staff identify Hulia Boz from the photos on her lost camera . Moments after recording the festive message on December 12, on day seven of her trip to Earth's southernmost continent, Ms Boz got up to go to the ‘bathroom’. ‘You’ve got to build a wall from ice to go to the toilet. I went to do my wee and the camera must have fallen out of my pocket, I didn’t realise,’ she said. The 34-year-old was unaware that she’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings. ‘The ship started to pull away and I thought “where is the camera? Where is the camera?” and we thought “no we were going to send it to Ellen!”,’ Ms Boz laughed. The story of how Ms Boz is now being reunited with her camera, which was white and camouflaged in the snow, is nothing short of a miracle. Before departing on the ship to Antarctica, Ms Boz and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in Ushuaia, Argentina – the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from. All tourists heading to Antarctica have these photos taken so they can be officially identified if need be. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to Antarctica when she lost her camera. She took the white Canon camera along on her trip so she could capture 'silly' photos and used her professional cameras for landscape photography . This picture shows Hulia's friend cosying up with a seal in Antarctica. Her friend took photos on her camera and shared them with Hulia when her camera was lost . She was lucky enough to get a spare place on the trip which cost her around $13,000 after being invited along by friends . Hulia and her fellow tourists were watching an Ellen DeGeneres episode before she lost her camera . A traveller with a different tour company, Quark Expeditions, miraculously found Ms Boz’s camera in the snow on the same iceberg near Useful Island in February and took it back to the port in Ushuaia, where they handed it in. Polar Operations Manager for Aurora travel Tomas Holik was given the camera ‘with no marking nor name on it’ and looked through the pictures stored on it, leading him to figure out that it belonged to Ms Boz as he compared the photos to the mugshots taken from recent expeditions. 'Once they saw all the young faces in the recording they found a voyage that happened to have young people on it.... they then sent my selfie to the ship's team leaders asking if they knew who I was,' Ms Boz explained. ‘By looking at its pictures I figured out that it belongs to a passenger of EAP27,’ Mr Holik wrote in an email to the Sydney-based tour company that Ms Boz travelled with. Before Hulia knew that she would ever be reunited with her lost camera her friend sent her these photos that she had taken of her . The 34-year-old was unaware that she’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings . Amongst the many memories from her two-week trip where plenty of fun selfies taken in the stunning snowy environment . The group were camping out on an iceberg in  Useful Island in December when she lost her camera . Assistant expedition leader Robyn Mundy replied: ‘I am amazed and astonished that someone found the camera. And returned it! We looked for it on the following voyage but there was still too much snow cover to find a white camera.’ ‘It does indeed belong to one of our EAP27 passengers, Hulia Boz. Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera! If you could possibly get it back to Sydney via a staff member or passenger, I’m sure Hulia will be eternally grateful,’ Ms Mundy replied. Ms Boz’s camera, which amazingly still works, is now on its way back to Sydney. ‘When they told me the person’s flight details and the name I thought this is really real. I hadn’t put out a plea on social media because there is nothing there but ice and penguins,' she said. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera . Hulia still intends to send the Christmas message to Ellen once her camera returns to her, even if it is a bit late . This photo shows the ship that the group travelled from Argentina to Antarctica in over four days . Hulia has called the trip and the surprise of someone finding her camera in the remote snow 'the most over whelming experience of my life' 'The effort, patience and goodwill that was put into reuniting me with my memories by strangers has amazed me. It has restored my faith in humanity. 'My camera was identified as my property by a selfie I had taken and the footage my friends and I had taken to send to Ellen DeGeneres as that was the last thing on the camera . 'I am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all. Miracles do happen. Even if Antarctica is twice as big as Australia. Even with no permanent residence. Even if the colour of my camera was white and would be difficult to detect on ice,' she said happily. 'This truly was and probably will be the most over whelming experience of my life. I met some amazing talented people who I shared some very special memories with, built friendships for life, did some crazy things and most of all have one amazing story to tell my grand kids one day.'",

The victim has been identified as Otis James Byrd, 54, who went missing on March 2 after his friend dropped him off at a casino in Vicksburg,  30 miles north from where his body was discovered. His family reported him missing on March 8. The NAACP was the first to identify Byrd. Officials have not yet confirmed the victim's identity, but local authorities were searching for the missing man when they found the body. If the death is ruled a murder, the NAACP's concerns are that is has echoes of a lynching. Byrd was convicted of murder in 1980, but was then paroled in 2006. He shot dead a white woman named Lucille Trim as he carried out an armed robbery. Scroll down for video . What happened? Otis James Byrd, 54 (pictured left and right), was found hanging from a tree in Mississippi after he went missing March 2 . Local, state and federal investigators are combing the scene off Old Rodney Road to determine the cause of death. He was found about 200 yards from his home. 'We don't know right now. All I can say is what I told you: It's under investigation,' Coroner J.W. Mallett said. Jim Walker, spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks said the body had 'obvious signs' of decay, suggesting it had been hanging there for at least a day. Mystery: Above, a hearse is seen parked near the scene of the hanging on Thursday. Investigators are trying to determine whether Byrd's death was a homicide or suicide . Without a trace: The body was found in a wooded area near Old Rodney Road in Port Gibson, Mississippi about 200 yards from his home. The last time he was seen, a friend was dropping him off at a casino in Vicksburg . Dark past: Above, Byrd's parole board mugshot. He was released from prison in 2006 after spending 25 years in prison for a murder conviction . The owner of the land, 87-year-old Johnie Baker, said that the area where Byrd's body was found is covered in pecan and black walnut trees. He added that hunters sometimes hunt in the area and that there are also wild boars on the land. So far, authorities say it's too early to determine whether the victim's death was a homicide or a suicide. However, the NAACP is petitioning to have the U.S. Department of Justice involved in the investigation, fearing Byrd's death may have been a hate crime. The Claiborne County Sheriff's Department and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation are also involved in the investigation. Lynching was a common form of 'mob justice' in the late 19th century, particularly in the south. A report by the Equal Justice Initiative claims there were nearly 4,000 lynchings of African Americans in the Jim Crow era across 12 states of the US. Byrd spent 25 years in prison for the murder of Lucille Trim, the Clarion-Ledger reported according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. He allegedly robbed Trimm of $101 and then killed her. He was convicted of capital murder in February 1980 and then was paroled in November 2006. Trim is the mother of Martha Ranville, who was the first woman in the history of the National Guard to serve as State Adjuntant General. She became the Adjutant General in Vermony in 1997 and currently lives in Virginia with her husband, the Hon. Paul McHale. McHale is a former Pennsylvania congressman and assistant secretary of defense.",

The parents say the trauma of the incident has affected their ability to connect with their son. Samantha and Nick Stuhlener welcomed baby Levi in January and were enjoying their precious first moments together at St Vincent's Private Hospital in the inner city Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy. However, the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple's baby, after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the 'settling room'. Scroll down for video . Levi was born on January 6 this year to proud parents Samantha and Nick Stuhlener at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Fitzroy . His mother, Samantha Stuhlener, has had trouble bonding with her cherished baby after a mix up at the hospital which saw her mistakenly spend 45 minutes with someone else's child . The two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at St Vincent's Private Hospital . 'I said what's happened, what's going on?' Ms Stuhlener told 7News. 'And she said, you didn't have Levi, you had somebody else's baby.' The error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought Mr and Mrs Stuhlener someone else's child. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff. 'It is extremely regrettable and our staff and myself feel gutted by the incident. We unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident,' he told 7News. He emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched, fed and changed by their parents. 'While both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times, the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands,' Mr Grisold said. Both children were wearing the correct ID wrist bands in the overnight settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the Stuhleners someone else's child . 'The second baby remained in the night nursery. 'When it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room, the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents. 'At no time was either baby picked up, held or fed by anyone other than their parents.' The hospital has told the distraught parents that Levi remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant. However, the Stuhleners are demanding the truth. 'I don't believe that,' Ms Stuhlener told 7News, unable to hold back tears. 'I don't know, was he (Levi) with another mother?' They have become suspicious as St Vincent's Hospital staff allegedly refuse to show the couple the incident report, which details where their baby was throughout the incident. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff . 'That's all we've wanted, to actually see what's written in the incident report and what actually happened,' said Mr Stuhlener. To make matters worse, the hospital's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix-up. Mr and Mrs Stuhlener received a letter of apology and $500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error. However, the hospital sent them the wrong letter. They received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap – the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes. 'I acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family,' Mr Griswold confirmed. The Stuhleners say they've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'. The couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family. Ms Stuhlener says she has had more difficulty bonding with Levi than she did with her firstborn.

        "input_text": "Animal rights activists were stunned when the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Feld Entertainment, announced it would eliminate elephants from its circuses by 2018. The elephants will then be retired to a conservation center in Florida. 'Monumental and long overdue,' was how the Animal Welfare Institute put it. 'Startling and tremendously exciting,' The Humane Society of the United States said in a statement. And the International Fund for Animal Welfare called it 'a giant step in the right direction.' But activists soon focused on the timing, questioning why it will take three years to phase out the elephants from the traveling circus shows. Elephants perform at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, at the Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida. The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus said it will phase out its iconic elephant acts by 2018 . Just days before the announcement, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis (TB). TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read. Scroll down for video . Elephants with the Ringling Bros. show appear in front of the Capitol in Washington in 2013. PETA says the company's move to retire its elephants heads off a scandal about the animals having TB while touring . As many as one-third of the elephants having tested positive for tuberculosis, and several Ringling employees have been treated for the disease . Ingrid E. Newkirk, president of PETA, said: 'Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis, so their retirement day needs to come now' The documents obtained by PETA reveal that in 2010, at least 11 elephants with the circus tested positive for TB, and that elephants used by Ringling have had TB since at least 1978. As many as one-third of the elephants having tested positive for the disease, and several Ringling employees have been treated for TB. TB carried by an elephant was linked to an outbreak among eight humans at an elephant sanctuary, some of whom had no direct contact with the elephant. PETA said the documents also show that Ringling consistently opposed efforts by officials to improve testing requirements for TB in elephants. According to former USDA attorney Kenneth Vail, who is now the Animal Welfare Act compliance officer for Feld Entertainment, TB is 'probably going to be the downfall of Feld’s elephants'. Ingrid E. Newkirk, president of PETA, added: 'Many of the elephants are painfully arthritic, and many have tuberculosis, so their retirement day needs to come now.' 'If the decision is serious, then the circus needs to do it NOW.' Kenneth Feld (left), CEO of Feld Entertainment, and his daughters, feed elephants at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Center for Elephant Conservation, in Polk City, Florida . However, executives at Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, say it will take three years to build proper facilities for them on the 200-acre plot of land in central Florida that's already being used as an elephant conservation center. They have repeatedly denied that the elephants are mistreated in any way in the circuses. 'Each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area,' said Stephen Payne, Feld's spokesman, adding that permits, drainage issues and other logistics must be worked out. The company intends for the elephants to live out their years on the property, and since one elephant is 69, they must plan for the long haul to care for the crop of gentle giants. The decision to phase out elephants from the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus comes at a time when cities across the United States are cracking down on exotic animal displays. Even before Thursday's announcement that the elephants will be phased out of Ringling's performances by 2018, company officials already said they were pulling out of certain cities because of newly enacted restrictions. Feld executives said the decision to end the circus's century-old tradition of showcasing elephants was difficult and debated at length. Elephants have often been featured on Ringling's posters over the decades. 'There's been somewhat of a mood shift among our consumers,' said Alana Feld, the company's executive vice president. 'A lot of people aren't comfortable with us touring with our elephants.' Feld owns 43 elephants, 29 of which live at the company's 200-acre Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida. One elephant is on a breeding loan to the Fort Worth Zoo. Thirteen animals will continue to tour with the circus before retiring to the center by 2018. The company plans to retire its remaining 13 touring elephants to its conservation center in Florida in 2018 . Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company, say it will take three years to build proper facilities for all thirteen elephants to join the 29 already on site at the 200-acre plot of land . Each elephant requires a certain amount of space and a certain amount of barn area, and permits, drainage issues and other logistics must also be worked out before the elephants can retire to the center . Another reason for the decision, company President Kenneth Feld said, was that certain cities and counties have passed 'anti-circus' and 'anti-elephant' ordinances. The company's three shows visit 115 cities throughout the year, and Feld said it's expensive to fight legislation in each jurisdiction. It's also difficult to plan tours amid constantly changing regulations, he said. Carol Bradley, who wrote a book about the freeing of an elephant, called the decision 'earth-moving' and thought the Felds would never change their minds . 'All of the resources used to fight these things can be put toward the elephants,' Feld said during an interview at the conservation center. 'We're not reacting to our critics; we're creating the greatest resource for the preservation of the Asian elephant.' Carol Bradley, the author of the book 'Last Chain on Billie: How One Extraordinary Elephant Escaped the Big Top,' which is about a non-Ringling circus elephant, said she believes the Feld family 'realized it was a losing PR battle.' 'This is an enormous, earth-moving decision,' she said. 'When I heard the news, my jaw hit the floor. I never thought they'd change their minds about this.' In 2014, Feld Entertainment won $25.2 million in settlements from a number of animal-rights groups, including the Humane Society of the United States, ending a 14-year legal battle over allegations that Ringling circus employees mistreated elephants. The initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 by a former Ringling barn helper who was later found to have been paid at least $190,000 by the animal-rights groups that helped bring the lawsuit. The judge called him 'essentially a paid plaintiff' who lacked credibility and standing to sue. The judge rejected the abuse claims following a 2009 trial. Kenneth Feld testified during that trial about elephants' importance to the show. 'The symbol of the 'Greatest Show on Earth' is the elephant, and that's what we've been known for throughout the world for more than a hundred years.' When asked by a lawyer whether the show would be the same without the elephants, Feld replied, 'No, it wouldn't.' The circus will continue to use tigers, dogs and goats, and a Mongolian troupe of camel stunt riders joined its Circus Xtreme show this year. The symbol of the 'Greatest Show on Earth' is the elephant but Feld Entertainment now admits that the public is no longer comfortable with them touring with elephants, and keeping up with changing regulations is tough . The circus business is changing and Feld is now investing in more motor sports. In 2010 it created a motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz (pictured) and has acquired a number of other acts . More motor sports, daredevils and feats of human physical capabilities will likely be showcased. In 2008, Feld acquired a variety of motor sports properties, including monster truck shows, motocross and the International Hot Rod Association, which promotes drag races and other events. In 2010, it created a theatrical motorcycle stunt show called Nuclear Cowboyz. Roughly 30 million people attend one of Feld's 5,000 live entertainment shows every year. Ringling's popular Canada-based competitor, Cirque du Soleil, features human acts and doesn't use wild animals. And while Ringling is phasing out the elephants, other, smaller circuses in the U.S. — and in countries such as Russia, France and Thailand — still use elephants. Feld owns the largest herd of Asian elephants in North America. It costs about $65,000 yearly to care for each elephant. Kenneth Feld said initially the conservation center will be open only to researchers, scientists and others studying the Asian elephant. He said he hopes it eventually expands 'to something the public will be able to see.' While Ringling Bros. is phasing out elephants, other, smaller circuses in the U.S. — and in countries such as Russia, France and Thailand — still use elephants in their performances . Kenneth Feld (pictured) feeds elephants Alana and Icky at the company's conservation center in Florida. Feld owns the largest herd of Asian elephants in North America, and it costs 65,000 yearly to care for each elephant . Celebrities reacted on Twitter to the news that Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will end elephant performances by 2018 in response to growing public concern over 'how the animals are treated'",

        "input_text": "An 85-year-old man has been plagued by non-stop egg attacks on his house for an entire year. Albert Clemens Senior’s home first became a target in March 2014, and the attacks have yet to stop, confounding neighbors, local government officials and even the police in Euclid, Ohio. Despite there being no let-up in the egg onslaught, no one has been able to identify the culprits. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago. Clemens’ wife has passed away, but he continues to live in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter. ‘The accuracy is phenomenal, because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door,’ says Clemens. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home . The frequency is troubling too, as the house is pelted with eggs several times a week, occasionally more than once a day. The egg offensive always begins after dark and lasts about 10 minutes. The latest an attack has come is 2 a.m., and the noise as an egg hits the front door or aluminium siding of the house has been compared to the crack of a gunshot. Al Clemens Jr told Fox8 Cleveland that eggs are about 80 per cent of the items thrown at his home. There have also been apples, oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits and canned goods. Dried egg residue covers the side of the house and has stripped away some of the paint. Albert Clemens Sr, 85, lives in the house with his 51-year-old son and 49-year-old daughter . The police believe that the eggs are being launched from a block or two north of the home and other than one or two mis-aimed eggs, few hit neighboring homes. ‘Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason,’ Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser told Cleveland.com. Local police are not taking the investigation lightly, trying undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighbourhood, installing surveillance cameras, and even sending eggshells to a crime lab for testing. At one point the entire community policing unit was on the case. Luckily for police the home is less than a mile from the police station and officers are able to respond quickly to each attack. The finger has been pointed at a couple suspects in the neighborhood over the course of the year since the attacks began. Clemens was once confronted by a young man across the street who asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighbourhood – suspected drug activity. Another nieghbor was suspected, but police saw him standing outside during an attack. The eggs have been traced back to a nearby Amish farm, but that yielded no further clues. Fingerprinting the eggs turned up nothing and the protein in eggs destroys any DNA evidence. Other lines of inquiry have suggested that the culprits are taking bad eggs from businesses that throw them away. The attacks are ruining the elderly man’s green two-story house on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street which he bought with his wife almost 60 years ago . The attacks have been so frequent that Clemens has been unable to keep up with the clean up . Officers visited local restaurants and outlets to ask about missing eggs. Neighbors have been questioned and fliers have been handed out, but nothing has turned up any leads. ‘The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently,’ Houser said. ‘I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it.’ Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. Indeed police involvement seems to do nothing to deter the perpetrators. An officer was hit on the foot by an egg while he was at the house when an attack was launched. \"The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge,\" Houser said. A reward of $500 was offered, and that was then upped to $1,000, but still no one came forward. If caught, the culprit will be charged with felony vandalism and criminal damage, and officers are not ruling out hate crime charges if there is evidence. Clemens (pictured) is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving: ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house – but it's been kind of a nightmare’ Clemens used to clean up after each attack but hasn’t been able to keep up. Worse, his insurance company will not settle any claim until the attackers are stopped, so no repairs can be made. The harsh winter has offered some respite for the family, as the egg attacks became less frequent. However once warmer weather comes, both Clemens and Euclid police expect the eggings to start again. Clemens is standing firm and has said he would never consider moving from his beloved home despite the onslaught of eggs. ‘I like the neighbourhood. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house – but it's been kind of a nightmare.’",

Channing Wells said on Wednesday that the baby will be named Josie Wells Jr., after his father. The last thing she told her husband was that she had an appointment - but not until next week - to learn whether the baby was a boy or a girl. Scroll down for video . Channing Wells (pictured on her wedding day with husband Josie in June 2012) has said her expectant baby will be named Josie Wells Jr, after his deputy U.S. Marshall father who was killed in the line of duty this week . Mrs Wells, an optometrist, said she didn't regret encouraging her husband to serve as a federal marshall and that he had died doing a job that he loved . 'The marshals took me to the hospital in Mississippi this morning so I could learn the baby's gender. ... It's bittersweet,' she said on Wednesday in a phone interview from Baton Rouge. Josie Wells, 27, was killed on the outskirts of that city on Tuesday in a shootout with a man suspected of killing two siblings outside a nightclub. The scene was about 130 miles from his home in the Jackson suburb of Raymond, Mississippi. The suspect, Jamie D. Croom, 31, of New Roads, Louisiana, was hit multiple times in the shootout. He died early Wednesday, East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner William 'Beau' Clark said. Before Croom died, the U.S. Attorney's Office charged him with the young deputy's murder. Channing Wells said the couple had been married nearly three years but had been together since both were 19 and going into their sophomore years at Jackson State University. He took a job at the fast-food restaurant where she worked: 'He stayed for one paycheck, just to get my phone number,' she said. After she finished four more years of school in Chicago to become an optometrist, Josie Wells missed a test of his own to drive her to another state for her board examination, she said. Deputy U.S. Marshal Josie Wells (left), 27, was fatally shot around 11am on Tuesday at Elm Grove Motel in Scotlandville - an area north of Baton Rouge. The fugitive, Jamie D. Croom (right), 31, from New Roads was shot and taken to a hospital where his condition has not been released . Later, she said, she encouraged her husband to look beyond his original ambition to service as a federal marshal. The fugitive, Jamie D. Croom, 31, was shot and taken to a hospital where his condition has not been released. He is facing murder charges . 'His dream was just to become a local police officer,' she said. 'I told him, 'Don't settle for that. Why don't you find the highest level of law enforcement you can do?'' Wells' father, Obie Wells Sr., who turns 57 Thursday, said he, too, had followed a family member into law enforcement. He retired from the sheriff's office in coastal Jackson County as a captain, and all of his sons followed him into the field. He said his surviving sons are a private security officer and police officers. One of his three daughters is studying criminal justice at Jackson State, where Josie Wells earned his bachelor's in the same subject. 'She was planning on doing an internship with Josie,' he said. Obie Wells, a self-described cowboy who keeps horses and used to keep cattle on his 100-acre spread in Wade, north of Pascagoula, said his longtime nickname is 'Josie' after the Clint Eastwood title character in 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.' He gave the name to his second son when his wife, Sherry, refused to let him follow George Foreman's example and name all of his sons Obie, he said. Josie Wells joined the U.S. Marshals Service immediately after getting his degree four years ago, Obie Wells said. Authorities said he was the first deputy marshal killed in the line of duty since 2011. Croom had a long criminal record and faced first-degree murder charges in the deaths of Lechelle Rita Williams, 42, and her brother Sinica Lee Williams, 38, said Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff Beauregard Torres III. 'It was drug-related — just an ongoing feud because of two sides,' Lt. Richard Torres said Wednesday. Channing Wells said that despite her husband's death, she doesn't regret encouraging him to join the U.S. Marshals Service. 'He wouldn't have been happy just being stuck in one position, not knowing there was more — that he could have a higher potential,' she said. And, she said, 'he died doing what he wanted to do and what he loved.' Croom has been on the run since the February 18 shooting outside the Sugar Shack nightclub in Pointe Coupee that left Lechelle Rita Williams (left), 42, and her 38-year-old brother Sinica Lee Williams (right) dead .",

According to a press conference on Tuesday given by Vallejo police officers, Denise Huskins was forcibly abducted against her will from her boyfriend's home. Her captor or captors also made off with a white Toyota Camry from the home that is registered to her boyfriend. The car was recovered hours afterwards at an undisclosed location miles away from the scene. The car and the home are both registered to Aaron Quinn who neighbors confirmed lives with Huskins in the two-story yellow home on Kirkland Avenue. The Daily Mail Online could not reach him for comment. Police Lt. Kenny Park said that police were first contacted at 1.55pm - hours after her alleged abduction - by her 30-year-old boyfriend who  was in the house at the time of the assault. Park would not comment on why Quinn appeared to wait so long before contacting them and added that the he is not in custody but that he is helping them 'piece the puzzle together.' Scroll down for video . Appeal: Police in Vallejo have asked the public for any help in locating physical therapist Denise Huskins who they believe has been kidnapped and held for ransom. They have issued the picture of her (left) and her Toyota Camry (right) which was recovered away from her home on Monday evening . Arrival: Denise (on the right) moved to Vallejo in June 2014 and began working at Kaiser Hospital and was previously a physical therapist at Southern California Orthopedic Institute . At the press conference Park did not say how the ransom was communicated nor how much is being demanded. Park also said he did not believe the house had been robbed according to the Sacramento Bee. 'We are concerned for Ms. Huskins' well-being,' said Lt. Kenny Park during the afternoon press conference . 'At this moment, Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom,' 'We have dedicated all our resources, and we are giving it full, undivided attention until we can locate Ms. Huskins and secure her safe return.' Search crews and dogs are combing the marsh lands of nearby Mare Island for Huskins. According to family Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital with her boyfriend and her father said he was stunned by the crime. 'This is overwhelming to me,' said Michael Huskins to CBS. 'I don't understand it. That's the hard part. I just don't understand what's going on.' 'If she sees this, I want her to know, that the family is there, we love her and we're not giving up,' he said. Home: Denise Huskins was taken against her will from her home on Kirkland Avenue (pictured) early on Monday morning . Police described her as 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. Suspicion had earlier fallen on a local peeping Tom who lived in the area recently, who had been spotted crawling on people's roofs. He has apparently moved away according to neighbors who spoke to ABC News. According to her Facebook page, Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital and Vallejo Police Department has called in help from the FBI and the Solano County Offie of Emergency Services. Officers released pictures of Huskins' boyfriend's car and asked for anyone who may have seen the vehicle during Monday afternoon or evening to contact them. Desperate search: Police would not say what the ransom was for Denise (left and second right with her mother) nor how they knew she had been abducted . Indeed, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, police have been unusually tight lipped about the incident. Once they received the report about the abduction, the alert was not sent over police radio but rather sent by phone between dispatchers and officers. This suggests her kidnapper is listening into police radio broadcasts. Huskins previously worked at a Southern California orthopedic institute and arrived in Vallejo in June 2014. Anyone with information on this case is asked to contact the Vallejo Police Department at 707-648-4524.",

        "input_text": "Pamela Smart's former teenage lover has been granted parole nearly 25 years after he shot her husband dead at her request. William 'Billy' Flynn, who murdered Gregg Smart in 1990, was granted parole by a three-person board in Concord, New Hampshire on Thursday, his 41st birthday. 'It's your birthday,' said board chairwoman Donna Sytek. 'We're granting you the privilege of parole.' Flynn has been in a Maine prison and participated in the hearing by telephone, telling the board that he'd always be haunted by the killing. 'I will always feel terrible about what happened 25 years ago,' he said. 'Parole will not change that.' Freed: Billy Flynn (pictured in court in 2008) has been granted parole after 25 years behind bars . He will not be freed before his parole eligibility date of June 4 - but when he does leave, he will be reunited with his wife, whom he married from behind bars, and a  stepdaughter. Smart, who is serving a life sentence, was an instructor in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced 15-year-old Flynn, a fellow volunteer. She told him she needed her 24-year-old husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced him. On May 1, 1990, Flynn, then 16, and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart, a sales representative for an insurance company, to his knees in the foyer, while another friend waited outside in a getaway car. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn shot him in the head. Before his parole decision was issued, the victim's brother, Dean Smart, read a letter from his 23-year-old daughter, Ashley. Family: Dean Smart (left), the brother of victim Gregg Smart, speaks during the parole hearing in Concord, New Hampshire on Thursday. He said that he hopes Flynn will now make something better of his life . Decision: A three-person board, pictured, granted the parole on Thursday, Flynn's 41st birthday . 'Mr. Flynn is only in this situation because he decided to play God one night and take an innocent man's life,' her letter said. 'You singlehandedly destroyed a whole family.' But Dean Smart struck a more hopeful note. 'I hope he does something great with his life,' he said. Before the parole was granted, another brother, Rick Smart, had told the Boston Herald that he believed Flynn should be freed because he was a teenager at the time and has served his time. 'Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he shouldn't have been punished,' he said. 'But I want to put this behind me and I'm sure he wants to put it behind him.' Flynn, who earned his GED and electrician's helper license behind bars, said finding a job will be his biggest challenge, noting that employers immediately search his name on the Internet. 'The first they learn about me is the worst thing I've ever done,' he said. Teacher:  Pamela Smart (seen in 1991) was convicted of conspiring with her teen lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24-year-old husband, Gregory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Student: In this 1991 file photo,  Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Gregory Smart in the head . To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. He was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus time served before trial. His age and testimony against Smart were taken into account at sentencing. Seven years ago, testifying on his motion for a reduced sentence, a tearful Flynn took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. 'I promise you I will carry this guilt and remorse with me every day for the rest of my life,' he said. Flynn married wife Kelly while behind bars in 2006 and has a stepdaughter. They married after Kelly, a divorcee, started writing to him in prison. By his side: Kelly Flynn, who married Flynn while he was behind bars in 2006, said in 2008 that she would be waiting for him to help him adjust when he came out. She is pictured at a hearing in his case in 2008 . Murdered: Smart's husband, Gregory Smart (seen on their wedding day), was shot in the head in May 1990 . 'The more I got to know Bill, the more I realized that he was not the same person who became involved with Pam Smart at the tender age of 15,' Kelly wrote in 2008 in a previous request for a suspended sentence, according to coverage in Seacoast Online. In the request, she wrote that when Flynn gets out of prison, she would help him adjust. 'I am not naive, but a 39-year-old woman with a teenage daughter, so I know there will be adjustments for all of us, and some of them may be hard,' wrote Kelly, who is now 48. Records show her daughter is now 23. She went on: 'Whether you decide that he gets out now, in a few years, or in many years, my commitment to him will not change. I am in this for life, because without him I would have less in my life and when I think of my future, I cannot see it unless it includes him.

Now another police dog has conducting another incredible rescued in in strikingly similar circumstances, after NSW Police dog Ulrich saved an elderly man who disappeared from hospital . On Monday, an 86-year-old man went missing from Maitland Hospital and a desperate three-day long search ensued. The man has been identified as Herbert 'Nobby' Bartlett and he had been in hospital recovering from a stroke he suffered six weeks ago, according to The Daily Telegraph. After four days missing he was found a mere eight minute walk from the hospital on Bonar Street, thanks to a dog who assumed his duties on Thursday morning and led police straight to the site. Police dog Ulrich found a lost man, 86-year-old Herbert Bartlett who was lost for four days in tall grass . Central Hunter Local Area Command had searched a number of towns using a great number of resources, including police officers, the SES and the Dog Unit. One of these dogs became an unassuming hero - a two-year-old German Shepherd named Ulrich. For almost four days Mr Bartlett was lost and disorientated laying helplessly in tall grass next to a lake. Police had already searched the area and surrounds numerous times but did not locate the lost man. However on Thursday morning, Ulrich was called in to investigate and reportedly led police straight to Mr Bartlett, locating the lost man by 11am. Fortunately, Mr Bartlett's condition reportedly had not deteriorate significantly despite his ordeal, according to The Daily Telegraph. The remarkable rescue came just days after an almost identical black German Shepherd saved an elderly man in similar circumstances . Police dog Marco found a dementia patient in an area that had also been scoured by police on the Central Coast - just an hour away from Ulrich's rescue in Maitland. Police were called to an aged care home at Mardi, on the NSW Central Coast, on Saturday night after a 65-year-old dementia patient was reported missing. The man had failed to return to the Wyong Aged Care Facility after going outside earlier in the day. A NSW Police dog named Marco has saved the life of a 65-year-old dementia patient on the central coast . Officers called at about 9pm searched nearby streets, a train station and the banks of the Wyong River with no success, prompting police to call in the Dog Unit to assist . Officers called at about 9pm searched nearby streets, a train station and the banks of the Wyong River with no success, prompting police to call in the Dog Unit to assist. One police dog - Marco – who was searching near the river repeatedly led his attached officer Senior Constable Patrick Summers to a specific spot on the river's steep embankment that had previously been searched with no luck. Snr Const Summers searched through the area's thick foliage and found the man stuck in the water and hidden behind a branch he was clinging onto just before 1am on Sunday. 'Even when I was right on him, I had my torch on him, I still couldn't make him out until I began shouting his name and there was a bit of movement and I thought \"wow\",' he told the Daily Telegraph. Marco – who was searching near the river - repeatedly led his attached officer Senior Constable Patrick Summers to a specific spot on the river's steep embankment that had previously been searched with no luck . 'Marco was persistent in leading me there.' Police said the man was in too much shock to call out, and would not have been able to hold on overnight putting him at risk of hypothermia or drowning. The man was rescued and treated for minor injuries by paramedics on the scene. Police were called to an aged care home at Mardi, on the NSW Central Coast, on Saturday night after a 65-year-old dementia patient was reported missing .",

The company has desperately been trying to rebrand their image after the former CEO Dov Charney was fired following the company's willful misconduct claims that he 'acted inappropriately' and 'sexually harassed employees.'

In the footage obtained by WSBTV, Anthony 'Tony' Hill, 27, can be seen walking outside the Heights at Chamblee apartment complex, climbing balconies and crawling around on the floor. Police responded to reports that an unclothed man was running around the complex and banging on people's doors. Officers arrived at the apartments just after 1pm on Monday. One witness told WSBTV that he told Hill to go inside otherwise he was going to get arrested. Scroll down for video . Erratic: A video shows 27-year-old Air Force veteran Anthony Hill walking around an apartment complex naked on Monday afternoon; he was later shot and killed by responding police officers . Concerns: Neighbors called police to report the naked man on balconies and knocking on doors . 'He was acting crazy but he was calm like he didn't know where he was,' said the witness, who did not wish to be identified. 'He was like kind of lost in his face.' An officer approached him and Hill turned towards him, authorities said. 'When the male saw the officer, he charged, running at the officer,' said DeKalb County Director of Public Safety Cedric Alexander. 'The officer called on him to step back, drew his weapon and fired two shots.' Witness Oscar Perez told ABC11Alive: 'The man, he was liked drugged, but he was naked and he was crawling. I think the police officer thought he was going to attack, so he shot him.' Hill was shot in the upper torso. The officer, who is white, is a seven-year veteran of the Dekalb County Police Department. He has not been identified. County police chief Cedric Alexander told reporters that the officer had been equipped with a Taser at the time of the shooting. He would not comment on whether the officer should have used the Taser but said that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation would take over the probe into the shooting. Veteran: Police said it was reasonable to assume that Hill, who was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East, was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the incident . Killed: Hill, pictured with his girlfriend Bridget, was shot after he ran at the officer, police have said . Heartbroken: Bridget took to Twitter on Monday to share her anguish over the death of her boyfriend . Shocked: Bridget said the couple had been celebrating three years together on Monday . He added that he could 'reasonably assume' that Hill was possible suffering from mental illness at the time, given his behavior. On his social media profiles, Hill had used the hashtag '#IAmBipolar'. In his final Facebook post on Monday morning, Hill wrote: 'Where i once saw death i only see life.' Social media also shows Hill was an Air Force veteran who had served in the Middle East. His girlfriend, Bridget Anderson, wrote on Twitter on Monday: 'My boyfriend was SHOT AND KILLED today by an officer. HE WAS UNARMED. Never in a million years did I think this would happen. 'I thought cops were suppose to protect and serve???? THEY TOOK THE LOVE OF MY LIFE AWAY!!!!!' She added on Twitter that Monday had been their three-year anniversary. Scene: Hill was shot twice by a white officer at the Heights of Chamblee apartment complex in Atlanta . Dekalb County police chief Dr Cedric Alexander, pictured last year, said the officer was also carrying a Taser . 'Who will I share my secrets with now?' she wrote. 'Who will I call when something good happens? How will I move on from this? Lord give me the strength.' Police forces across the country have come under fire for their use of lethal force, especially against ethnic minorities, the poor and the mentally ill. Mr Alexander added: 'We have already, as many departments have begun to do, look at how do we expand our mental health training. It appears that we're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who may be in distress.' Hill is at least the third African-American since last Friday who has or has appeared to have been unarmed when killed by police. Police near Denver last Friday fatally shot an unarmed man who was a wanted fugitive. On the same day, an officer in Madison, Wisconsin fatally shot a biracial 19-year-old, prompting some 2,000 students to march in the state's capital on Monday. See below for video .",

'We’ve been clear that the end of March is a firm deadline, and that’s simply because these negotiations have taken place over the course of more than a year,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Friday afternoon. 'That should be ample opportunity for us to reach an agreement.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, center, lit, talks with members of his delegation after a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and other officials at the Beau Rivage Palace Hotel on Friday. Major powers and Iran were pushing each other for concessions ahead of an end-March deadline for a preliminary nuclear deal, with Tehran demanding an immediate end to sanctions and freedom to continue sensitive atomic research, officials said . Kerry, left, U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, 2nd left, and others, including Head of Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation Ali Akbar Salehi, 2nd right, and  Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, right, particpate in a Friday meeting at the Beau Rivage Palace on Friday in Lausanne, Switzerland . The timetable for the details of the agreement to be set in stone continues to be the end of June. 'But where we need to start, is the outlines of a political agreement,' he said, which 'is something we are aiming to achieve by the end of March.' U.S. officials and their foreign counterparts in the P5 +1 group - the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council along with Germany - were in Switzerland on Friday with Iran's negotiators making a desperate last ditch bid to secure a landmark agreement - 13 years since the country's nuclear program became public. Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said earlier this week an agreement was 'deliverable' but urged Iran to make 'tough decisions' ahead of the meeting in Lausanne, on the shores of Lake Geneva. Along with five world powers, Britain is seeking a deal that would allow Iran to continue its Uranium enrichment program while reducing the likelihood of it gaining nuclear weapons. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told reporters staking out the talks that he didn't have a strong sense if an acceptable agreement could be made in the next several days. 'The negotiations are difficult and complicated and there . are highs and lows,' Zarif said, according to Reuters. 'We think an agreement is still . possible but when is another story. Our feeling is that we . certainly will be able to reach an agreement, but that will need . political will on the other side.' The White House said Friday that it continued to believe the coalition had a 50 percent chance of convincing Iran to make the required concessions by the last day of the month, Tuesday, March 31. 'It’s still at best 50-50,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday. 'That’s the odds that I have previously given to the likelihood of an agreement being reached before the deadline, and those odds have not changed.' Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, left, talks with the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization Ali Akbar Salehi after Friday's meeting. An Iranian official told Reuters that lingering issues with the international coalition, which includes, China, Russia and France in addition to Germany, Britain and the U.S., were over research and development and U.N. sanctions . Still 'fluid' next week is Obama's schedule. The White House declined to give reporters a preview on Friday, as is generally expected, of the president's plans beyond a Monday trip to Boston, Massachusetts, leaving him open to take on a more direct role in negotiations. The president has been receiving regular and at least 'daily' updates on the situation, his spokesman said Friday. After the afternoon briefing the White House sent reporters a notice that Obama had called German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the state of negotiations. The statement said the two world leaders agreed that 'Iran must make decisions necessary to resolve several remaining issues.' It did not provide details on what those deal-breaking matters were. An Iranian official told Reuters, however, that lingering issues with the coalition, which includes, China, Russia and France in addition to Germany, Britain and the U.S., were over research and development and U.N. sanctions. Iran reportedly wants an immediate draw down of sanctions, which the U.S. and its partners have said is a deal-breaker. The White House reiterated on Friday that only after it verified, over time, that Iran was keeping up its end of the pact would it ask Congress to ease sanctions on the country. Another Iranian negotiator told AFP on Friday that as far as his country is concerned, 'It all depends on the willingness of the other side. All the solutions are on the table.' 'We have already done what we need to do,' he stated. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani reached out directly to the leaders of France, Russia, Britain and China on Thursday in an attempt to break the stalemate and passed on letters to all six members of the international coalition, including President Obama. Elsewhere, the hawkish French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has warned against a soft deal during negotiations. 'Tough decisions': This map helps demonstrate how Iran's nuclear program is spread across the country . Britain's Hammond warned failure to achieve a deal over Iran's nuclear program could trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Iran's nuclear program became public in 2002 when an opposition group revealed secret activity including construction of an uranium enrichment plant and a heavy-water reactor. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, while spent fuel from a heavy-water reactor contains plutonium suitable for a bomb. Following that, Iran agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But the IAEA could not confirm whether it had tried to  develop nuclear weapons. This led the P5+1 to press Iran to stop enriching uranium. Talks failed and in 2005 the IAEA referred Iran to the UN Security Council for failing to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Since then, the Security Council has adopted six resolutions requiring Iran to stop enriching uranium, some imposing sanctions. In 2012, the US and EU began imposing additional sanctions on Iranian oil exports and banks, putting pressure on Iran to negotiate. Tehran insists its program is for civil nuclear power, but the international community has imposed sanctions amid concerns Iran harbors ambitions to create nuclear weapons. In a speech in London, Hammond said he was clear that 'no deal is better than a bad deal' if talks in Switzerland break down this weekend. 'But we should also be clear-eyed about the alternative,' he said. 'No deal means no restrictions on enrichment, no restrictions on research and development, and no independent monitoring or verification. It means a fundamentally more unstable Middle East, with the prospect of a nuclear arms race in the region.' He added: 'So now is the time, with our key allies, to build on the recent momentum, to press Iran where differences remain, and to strain every sinew to get a deal over the finishing line. The door to a nuclear deal is open, but Iran must now step through it.' Iran and the P5+1 agreed an interim accord in November 2013 that saw it cut down on sensitive nuclear activities in return for temporary relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy. A deadline of July 2014 was set to find a 'comprehensive solution', but the talks were subsequently extended by four months to give negotiators more time. Despite 'significant progress' being made, both sides agreed in November that another seven months were needed. Diplomats now hope to reach a rough deal this weekend with all-important technical details decided by June 30.",

He was born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, until middle-school when his family moved to Holland, Michigan, the Marines said. Seif, 26, grew up playing soldier in his backyard and joined the Marines just weeks after graduating from high school, according to an article about his award published this week in the Camp Lejeune Globe, the post newspaper. By 2012, he had spent two years as a special forces operator with the 2nd Marine Special Operations Battalion, which operates from the Middle East to Central Asia. Seif and his teammate, Sgt. Justin Hansen, were closing in on one of western Afghanistan's bomb experts, according to the paper. They came under fire, and Hansen was hit. Seif moved Hansen to safer position and treated his teammate's wounds. Seif returned fire, advanced alone across the compound and found the targeted bomb-maker. 'The fact that (Seif) continued to fight through the objective to get Sgt. Hansen taken care of, putting himself in the line of fire, speaks volumes to who he is and demonstrates that he would never leave a Marine behind,' said Maj. Gen. Joseph L. Osterman. Seif's wife was at his side when he received the medal. Staff Sgt. Trevor P. Blaylock, 29, was born in Lake Orion, Michigan, and swam on the varsity swim team.

Kerry Michael Kemp, 27, was the proud father of a baby just shy of her first birthday and loved horsing around with his nephews. 'He would wrestle with them. He really got into that, the wrestling and playing. He'd carry them around on his back,' said his sister-in-law, Lora Waraksa. He was a \"proud Marine, a loving husband and most wonderful father,\" she said. He also loved golfing and the ocean — he often took his nephews out to hunt for sea shells. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Kemp met his wife, Jenna, at Port Washington High School in Wisconsin, where he was voted \"best smile\" by his senior class. He graduated in 2005. He started as an artillery mechanic, and his military merit led to three quick promotions. He completed training in special operations in 2012 and spent seven months in Afghanistan before returning in June. Meanwhile, divers have found the wreckage of the military helicopter in just 25 feet of water. A small memorial stands in the sand along Highway 98 in Navarre, Florida . 'It was certainly a high-impact crash,' said Eglin Fire Chief Mark Giuliano, and 'very, very, very dense fog' was complicating the response. There's almost no visibility at the spot where the wreckage was found, forcing search crews to move slowly to avoid colliding with each other, and the surf is too rough still to pull the wreckage to the surface. Dozens of airmen walked the shores of Santa Rosa Sound Thursday, recovering pieces of clothing and bits of wreckage, but the U.S. Coast Guard suspended its search Thursday afternoon, and will instead focus on helping the Army recover the remaining fuselage and debris, it said. President Barack Obama has promised a thorough investigation into the cause, which is being led by the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center out of Fort Rucker, Alabama. The helicopter went down Tuesday night in fog so thick that another helicopter turned back. American flags stand in the median near the bridge entrance to Navarre Beach, Florida . A woman at campground nearby, Kim Urr, said she heard a metallic sound and then two muffled explosions as it disappeared into the narrow waterway separating Santa Rosa Island from the Florida panhandle mainland. This dense sea fog, which could persist through Friday, is common when warm southern air meets cold water this time of year, said Jack Cullen, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Mobile, Alabama. The same fog enveloped a large gathering holding a vigil on a pier Wednesday night. Crashing Gulf waves created a somber backdrop to the songs, tears and prayers of the people, who have strong ties to the military and the sprawling Eglin Air Force Base. 'My heart is really hurt right now knowing these people were here just on training - knowing they went and left their family members and did not give that goodbye, you know, because they weren't going off to war,' said a tearful Dolly Edwards, herself the wife of a Marine.",

The woman, named locally as Mitchelle Blair, 35, was arrested after the frozen bodies of a boy, approximately 11-years-old, and a girl, around 14-years, were discovered inside a plastic bag. It is believed the pair had been dead for more than a year when the grim discovery was made by bailiffs carrying out an eviction at the Martin Luther King apartments on Tuesday morning. It has been claimed that Blair allegedly confessed to strangling her son in May 2012, according to WXYZ, who are quoting a police source. She is also said to have admitted torturing her daughter to death just nine months later,  the news channel reported. Scroll down for video . Neighbors say the mother police currently have in custody is Michelle Blair, 35, and that she goes by Angel . Inside the home where the bodies of two children, aged approximately 11 and 14 years old, had been inside a Detroit freezer for more than a year . Police said the bodies appeared to a male aged approximately 11 years old and a female who was approximately 14 years old. They were found inside a plastic bag and appeared to be 'frozen' Blair, who has two other children - 11-year-old son and a 17-year-old daughter - has not been charged and is said to be a person of interest in the police investigation. Police were called in by the bailiffs after they discovered the girl's body in the chest freezer next to the front door. Her siblings corpse was found later. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said the mother was taken into custody after an apartment resident informed officers she was staying with someone at a different home inside the complex, according to the Detroit News. Craig said the mother, who was handcuffed when the was taken into custody. Neighbors say Blair and that she goes by Angel,WXYZ Detroit reported. Blair describes herself as 'Loyal to my babies' on her Facebook page. Blair posted a photo with a message in January . On January 30, the posted a photo with a message. It read: 'There is no greater blessing than being called MOM.' Before she was taken into custody, the mother reportedly said her son was raped and that the sexual assault had been carried out by his siblings. Police have not confirmed that is the case and it is unclear if she was talking about the boy who was found in the freezer. She filed a paternity suit in 1999 which resulted in a man being ordered to pay child support. Blair filed another suit in 2007 against another man which had the same result. She had not been charged as of Tuesday evening. Her brother Marlon Blair said: 'It's too early to even say what this could be, or to make any judgments. 'She didn't have any emotional problems from what I'm aware of. I don't know what to say about this.' Assistant Chief Steve Dolunt said it appeared the bodies had been in the freezer for 'over a year' and that the mother had been living in the apartment 'with other children while the bodies were in the freezer'. 'This is a terrible situation,' he said. According to Craig, Blair has two other children, aged 11 and 17, who are unharmed and currently in 'protective custody'. No weapons were discovered after the apartment was searched and police do not yet have a motive. Neighbor Shanetria Lanier, 21, said Blair home-schooled her children and 'that's why no schools were wondering where they were'. There is no record of the children attending classes, according to a Detroit Public Schools official. People did notice that two of her children seemed to disappear about a year ago. Lanier said: 'When people asked her where her other two kids are, she said they were at their aunt's house. 'Or sometimes she'd tell people they stayed inside because they didn't like to be around people.' Craig said the police are still 'trying to determine what happened'. The cause of death won't be known until after autopsies are conducted. Tori Childs, who also lives in the complex, told the Detroit News she often saw the children and sometimes gave them clothes or food. She said they were 'the nicest kids' who were 'so respectable'. 'This is just wrong,' she said in tears. Childs said she saw two bodies on the floor after police arrived at the home. 'It was a little girl and a little boy,' she said. 'The little girl had on a pink jacket.' A neighbor, Tori Childs (center), was led away from the scene as law enforcement investigated on Tuesday . Police said the mother was taken into custody and is a person of interest. Her two other children, aged 11 and 17, are unharmed and in protective custody. No weapons were found when the apartment was searched . Shanetria Lanier, another neighbor in the complex, said her sister received a phone call around 6am on Tuesday from a woman who lives inside the apartment. The woman asked to stay at Lanier's sister's home with her two children that day, according to Lanier, and was there when the bodies were found.

Wellington-based Brian and Angela Blackwood have launch an online petition to campaign for Philip Backwood's freedom, insisting that their son and his colleagues have been unjustly convicted. They have revealed their pain they feel as they can not help their son, who is being subjected to the brutal conditions inside Yangon's notorious Insein Prison. He has been sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. He has been held in the jail since his arrest in December. 'He sleeps on a wooden pallet, no bedding is allowed, no mattress, no pillow,' Brian told ABC. He is only allowed to see his fiancé Noemi Alamo and their seven-month-old daughter for an hour every fortnight. Scroll down for video . Philip Blackwood (C) is escorted by police to a court hearing in Yangon. Blackwood and his two Myanmar colleagues were sentenced  to two and a half years in jail for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks . Two weeks ago the bar manager and his two Myanmar colleagues were jailed for two and a half years with hard labour by a Yangon court for using a Buddha image to promote a cheap drinks night. However, Blackwood's hard labour penalty has been lifted as he is a foreigner. The ad posted on Facebook in December caused a stir of outrage in the former junta-ruled country, where surging Buddhist nationalism and religious violence has sparked international concern. Philip Blackwood, who worked at the VGastro bar in Yangon, was found guilty of insulting religion, after the New Zealander posted a mocked-up photo of the Buddha wearing DJ headphones on Facebook — in reference to a well-known international club brand. The three convicted men have the support of a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The group have condemned the court's ruling and called for the unconditional release of Mr. Blackwood and his colleagues. 'It is ludicrous that these three men have been jailed simply for posting an image online to promote a bar,' a spokesperson for Amnesty International in South East Asia and the Pacific said. “They should be immediately and unconditionally released.” According to International commission of Jurists in the Asia and Pacific, the conviction violates Mynamar's own legal standards. 'The conviction violates international standards for imprisoning people for speech (and) seems to violate Myanmar’s own legal standards which require intent.' Blackwood's loved ones are fighting to help alleviate some of Blackwood's struggles during his sentence. 'He has a hole in the ground for a toilet and he has a bucket of water that he washes in, keeps himself tidy with. 'He is only given broth and rice to eat. 'I don't believe that we understand half of what he is suffering.' Mr Blackwood leaves court after being sentenced to two and half years in prison. He was found guilty of insulting Buddhism . Blackwood, the manager of VGastro Bar in Yangon, was arrested  after posting a promotional image of a psychedelic Buddha wearing headphones to the bar's Facebook page . Blackwood's parents worry for their son's physical and mental health, as he tries to withstand the heat and poor hygiene. They are particularly concerned as their son suffers from a chest condition and from asthma. The 32-year-old was arrested by Myanmar police in December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up. The harsh conviction comes despite Mr and Mrs Blackwood's insistence that 'The judge's ruling that the three had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' was not founded on any concrete evidence at all. 'Mr. Blackwood did not have legal representation when he was charged, nor did he have any interpreter to explain what was going on,' the petition reads. 'Three months later, they were found guilty, despite prosecution not having established intent on the side of the three accused.' A Buddhist monk tries to take a photo of New Zealander Philip Blackwood as he gets into a police vehicle outside the court . VGastro Bar employee Htut Ko Ko Lwin is escorted to a police vehicle after appearing in court in Yangon on Thursday. The trio could face two years in jail for breaching Myanmar's Religion Act . In emotional scenes after the verdict, family members of the two Myanmar defendants expressed shock and fury at the sentencing, with the mother of one exchanging barbs with a handful of nationalist monks waiting outside. The case has been watched closely by international observers amid fears that the Buddhist-majority country, which has seen a surge in foreign investment since it began emerging from the grip of the military in 2011, is seeing its much-lauded reforms stalling. The trio were also held responsible for protests that erupted outside the bar over the image. Judge Ye Lwin said that while Blackwood, 32, had posted an apology, he had 'intentionally plotted to insult religious belief' when he uploaded the photo. He added that although the New Zealander had admitted to posting the picture without intending to offend, it was also 'unreasonable only to blame the foreigner' when explaining the guilty verdicts for the Myanmar defendants. Htut Ko Ko Lwin's mother screamed at a group of monks taking photos with smartphones outside the court after the sentencing. The wife of bar owner Tun Thurein said she would consult her lawyer about appealing. 'They just decided everybody is guilty so I'm very shocked. This is very unfair,' Myat Nandar said. Blackwood made no comment as he was bundled into the back of a police truck through a scrum of media cameras. Myanmar has been rocked by several deadly outbreaks of religious violence in recent years, mainly targeting the Muslim minority. The bloodshed has coincided with the rising influence of hardline monks, who have advocated controversial new laws. Rights groups say these would severely curb the freedom of religious minorities and women. V Gastro bar, which opened just two weeks before the incident, swiftly deleted the offending image and posted this apology on its Facebook page . Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said Tuesday's sentences showed 'freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever' in Myanmar, which is gearing up for crucial elections later this year. 'The authorities should accept the heartfelt public apology of the three men, vacate the conviction, and order them to be released immediately and unconditionally,' he said in a statement. Blackwood's parents told Fairfax Media from their New Zealand home that they were shocked by the decision and their son would consider an appeal. 'We hoped common sense would prevail and he would be found not guilty because it was not a malicious or intentional act...' said father Brian Blackwood. The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country .",

        "input_text": "A momentous and valuable piece of our evolutionary history has gone on display to the public. The 2.8 million-year-old partially complete lower jaw, uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. It is significant because it suggests our first human ancestors emerged 400,000 years earlier than previously thought. The fossil is now encased in a glass box at the Arizona University. Scroll down for video . The 2.8 million-year-old partially complete lower jaw (pictured), uncovered in the Afar region of Ethiopia, is thought to belong to a species that may have been the first member of the Homo family. The fossilised remains were put on display inside a glass case at Arizona University earlier this week . It was unveiled at a press conference by  Professor Kaye Reed, one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in January 2013. Scientists say the fossil, which is known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family. This would make it the common ancestor for modern humans - Homo sapiens - and their extinct relatives including Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Neanderthals. Researchers who have digitally reconstructed the jaws of other ancient human ancestors say the fossil also matches what they would expect from this common ancestor. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.8 million years ago - LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . The discovery, which was found in the Ledi-Geraru area of Afar, has put a new date on the emergence of the first 'man' from our more ape-like ancestors. Dr Brian Villmoare, from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, helped lead the fossil hunters, said: 'In spite of a lot of searching, fossils on the Homo lineage older than two million years ago are very rare. 'To have a glimpse of the very earliest phase of our lineage’s evolution is particularly exciting. 'LD 350-1 reveals that many of the anatomical patterns we see in 2 million-year old Homo were established much earlier in the evolution of the genus. 'At 2.8 million years ago we see relatively evolved Homo traits in combination with other much more primitive anatomical features.' The researchers, whose work on the fossil is published in the journal Science, say the fossil could be a key missing link between the Homo lineage and a more primitive and ape-like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called Australopithecus. Details of the Australopithecus are best known from a fossil named ‘Lucy’, dating back 3.2 million years, which was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. But exactly how Homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record. The new discovery has helped to fill that gap. Scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the Homo family from those belonging to Australopithecus. Until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils. Scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape-like hominins. Dr William Kimbel, director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University who was also involved in the research, said: 'The Ledi jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between Australopithecus and early Homo. 'It’s an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution.' The bone was unveiled at a press conference by Professor Kaye Reed (pictured), one of the palaeontologists who made the discovery in January 2013. Scientists say the fossil, known as LD 350-1, is recognisably human but also has more primitive features that suggests it is older than other fossils belonging to the Homo family . The fossilised lower jawbone, shown above with teeth still in the bone, was found in Ledi-Geraru in Ethiopia . The fossilised jawbone was first discovered by student Chalachew Seyoum from the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage in Ethiopia in January 2013. Until now, the earliest evidence of the existence of the first Homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million-year-old fossils. The jawbone is pictured . It is thought to be the left side of an adult's lower jawbone that has canine, premolars and three molars still preserved in the jaw. Mr Seyoum said he was ‘stunned’ when he saw the fossil. ‘The moment I found it, I realised that it was important, as this is the time period represented by few fossils in Eastern Africa,’ he told BBC News last night. Dating of the fossil and the surrounding sediment suggest it is between 2.8 million and 2.75 million years old. Other fossils of antelope, prehistoric elephants and hippos discovered alongside the jawbone suggest that this early Homo species lived in open grassland and shrub habitats. This matches the picture that scientists believe was occurring around this time of climate change creating increasingly arid conditions in Africa. These are thought to be one of the main driving forces that led to the evolution of the Homo lineage and eventually our own species. Australopithecus, by contrast, was thought to inhabit far wetter environments and this may have contributed to their eventual demise. The researchers said that the changes in the new jawbone compared to Australopithecus suggest that evolution of different jaw shapes may have been a key step in the divergence of the two lineages. Professor Kaye Reed, also from Arizona State University, said: 'We can see the 2.8 million year aridity signal in the Ledi-Geraru faunal community, but it’s still too soon to say that this means climate change is responsible for the origin of Homo.' The images above show the jawbone from different angles and how many of the teeth still remain in place . Anthropologists digging tin the Ledi-Geraru, pictured above, discovered the new jawbone in January 2013 . The new fossil has helped fill a huge gap in the evolutionary history (above) of how the Homo family appeared . Another study published in the journal Nature has also provided convincing evidence that LD 350-1 was a common human ancestor to the Homo family. The jawbone was found in the Ledi-Geraru area, marked with a star on the map above, of Ethiopia . They used 3D imaging techniques to scan partial skull of Homo habilis - a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname 'handy man'. It reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure, indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like. Their findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago - Homo habilis, Homo erectus and Homo rudolfensis. Scientists used 3D imaging techniques to reconstruct the skull of Homo hablis (left) which has provided clues about how this now extinct member of our evolutionary branch would have looked. The image on the right shows an early reconstruction of Homo hablis at the Westfälisches Museum for Archaology in Herne . They found that the ancestor of Homo habilis would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone LD 350-1. Professor Fred Spoor, a researcher of evolutionary anatomy at University College London and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, said: 'By digitally exploring what Homo habilis really looked like we could infer the nature of its ancestor, but no such fossils were known. 'Now the Ledi-Geraru jaw has turned up as if ‘on request’, suggesting a plausible evolutionary link between Australopithecus afarensis and Homo habilis.' This reconstruction of the jaw of Homo habilis by the UCL team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of Homo erectus or Homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of  Australopithecus afarensis . Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, said the discovery of LD 350-1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species. He said: 'It gives us a better understanding of what was happening at the earlier end of the genus Homo. 'Finds like Kenyanthropus (a 3.5 million year old ape-like species) have made it harder to understand the relationship between the Australopithecines and us - in short it’s the replacement of the old fashioned unilinear model of a evolutionary branch with a multiple species based evolutionary bush. 'What’s becoming clear is that we have only a small part of the jigsaw puzzle. This new fossil may well be a member of our genus, an australopithecine or an hitherto unknown genus.'",

Teresa A. Sullivan said the agency's top priority should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law adding 'getting arrested shouldn't involved getting stitches.' Video of the student's bloody arrest by officers was shared on social media and sparked protests on campus after he was seen lying on the ground, hands tied, saying 'I go to UVA, I go to UVA.' Scroll down for video . Questions: UVA president Teresa A. Sullivan, pictured, said the Alcoholic Beverage Control should be to ensure that people who hold liquor licenses adhere to the law and not leaving people needing stitches . Hurt: Lawmakers are calling for change after the fallout from black student Martese Johnson's brutal arrest, seen here, as he lay bloody on the pavement after the scuffle with officers in the early hours of Wednesday . Scene: The incident  occurred as Johnson stood outside Trinity Irish Pub just blocks from the campus but the venue has denied racially profiling patrons in a statement . The 20-year-old, wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt and pink top could also be heard saying: 'How did this happen, you fuc**** racists.' Johnson, a Chicago native who is majoring in Italian and Media Studies, was arrested by Virginia's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) at 12:45 a.m. Wednesday. Cops swooped in and arrested the student - who could be seen on video bleeding profusely - after he was accused of trying to get into Trinity Irish Pub, near campus with a fake ID. Following widespread condemnation of the footage, Sullivan, along with several high-profile lawmakers in Virginia are now calling for a reexamination of ABC's arrest powers. She told The Washington Post: 'As to the other issues, like having a fake ID and underage drinking and son on – both Charlottesville and university police do arrest people for that.' Sullivan is backed by Marcus L. Martin, UVA's vice president and chief officer for diversity and equity. He said he spoke with Johnson, and he was not intoxicated when he was arrested. On Wednesday night, hundreds of students gathered at the University of Virginia campus to demand justice for Johnson. There was also a separate march through the town . Support: Marcus L. Martin, left, UVA's vice president and chief officer for diversity and equity, said he spoke with Martese Johnson, and he was not intoxicated when he was arrested by state liquor control. State House Minority Leader David Toscano, right, called the image of the arrest 'very disturbing' Johnson, pictured left, is an honor student at the university, which has seen a string of controversies this year . But video of Johnson's bloodied face, caused by a gash to his head led House Minority Leader David Toscano to call the arrest 'very disturbing.' Meanwhile, Senator Donald McEachin has added his voice to the chorus of disapproval over ABC's   arrest powers. He now wants to consider sponsoring legislation that would give state police jurisdiction of the state's alcohol laws. Johnson, an honor student was charged with public intoxication and or swearing and obstruction of justice for the St Patrick's Day night incident outside the Trinity Irish Pub. He was released Wednesday morning. Protests erupted at the campus following the arrest. On Wednesday night, a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for their classmate. It has also emerged that contrary to officers' suspicions, Johnson did not have a fake ID and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it, according to his friend. His roommate Joshua Kinlaw said: 'So the ID that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control] officers was his real ID. 'Now because the age on that ID shows him to be 20 years old, I think that's when dispute and discrepancies came in.' Johnson, seen here on Thursday, was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice. He said through his lawyer, right, that he was 'shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement' Defense: Joshua Kinlaw, left, pictured speaking to ABC News, said  the ID that Johnson actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC was his real ID, but the zip code he gave was for his mother's, right, address rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers . On Thursday, his lawyer, Daniel Watkins, backed these claims and said that the student was simply standing on the sidewalk when officers approached him. This led Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to call for a state police investigation into the arrest. Additionally, Attorney General Mark R. Herring said he is now considering a review of arrest data to determine if there was any racial bias involved from the law enforcement agencies. But in a statement, Trinity Irish Pub, (the establishment that Johnson tried to get in) said managers refute claims made by a former employee that staff were instructed to  racially profile. The statement, obtained by WVIR-TV said: 'There have been reports that Trinity engages or engaged, in this incident, in racial profiling in not permitting Mr. Johnson to enter. 'The rationale for allowing patrons to enter — being familiar with the zip code on their own license — is color, gender, race, and ethnicity-blind. 'Comments made by a previous employee by the name of Dante DeVito that Trinity instructs its management to scrutinize persons of color for entry, are patently false. 'Mr. DeVito was employed by Trinity for six months and was terminated by management for cause. His comments are those of a disgruntled former employee and are not accurate.' The pub also said that Johnson was turned away after he gave an incorrect zip code to go with his ID. Yet, the student later said that he gave the ZIP code of the address where his mother currently lives rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers. The legal drinking age in Virginia is 21 years old and Johnson has maintained his innocence saying he was not intoxicated, according to CNN. Johnson said his 'head lay bloody, but unbowed.'

Indian cleric Zakir Naik, who has also said 9/11 was an inside job, was handed the King Faisal International Prize for Services to Islam at a glittering ceremony in Riyadh. A physician by training, the Mumbai-based 49-year-old has carved out a career as a charismatic television preacher, but his controversial views have led to him being banned from entering the UK. And the winner is... Saudi King Salman bin Abdul Aziz presents Zakir Naik, president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, with the 2015 King Faisal International Prize for Service to Islam . Dr Naik was one of five winners presented a gold medal, a certificate hand written in Arabic calligraphy and an endowment of more than £130,000 by Saudi King Salman during a ceremony at a luxury hotel yesterday. The president of the Islamic Research Foundation in India, Dr Naik was honoured for being one of the most renowned non-Arabic speaking promoters of Islam. He founded the Peace TV channel, billed as the world's only channel specialising in comparative religion, which now reaches an estimated English-language audience exceeding 100million, according to his award citation. 'Islam is the only religion that can bring peace to the whole of humanity,' he said in a video biography aired at the ceremony. It was on a broadcast on Peace TV that Dr Naik suggested that Muslims men may rape their slaves. 'There are many verses in the Koran which say you can have sex with your wife and with whatever your right hand possesses,' he told a mass audience at one event. 'Right hand possesses,' he went on. 'Which means your slaves.' He goes on to qualify his statement by saying the world at the time of the Prophet Mohammed was beset by war, making slavery more common, and that a pious Muslim would marry the slave he wanted to have sex with first. But the remark seems to be a disturbing echo of the doctrines of the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency. Last October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the sexual enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority'. 'Enslaving the families of the kuffar (non-believers) and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Sharia,' the article pronounced. Inside the Islamic State: Last October, the terror group published an article on its propaganda page stating that the sexual enslavement of captured Yazidis was justified because they are a 'pagan minority' 'Inside job': Dr Naik has claimed the then-President George W Bush was behind the September 11 attacks . Dr Naik's controversial comments have extended beyond sexual politics. In a July 2008 Peace TV broadcast he suggested that Al-Qaeda was not responsible for flying hijacked airliners into New York's World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, killing almost 3,000 people. 'Even a fool will know that this was an inside job,' he said in the video, claiming then-President George W. Bush was behind the attacks. In 2010 Dr Naik was barred from entering Britain after the Home Secretary cited 'numerous comments' which showed his 'unacceptable behaviour'. During his acceptance speech at Riyadh's Al Faisaliah Hotel last night, Dr Naik told dignitaries he would be donating his prize money to Peace TV. The annual prizes are a project of the King Faisal Foundation, established in 1976 by the children of King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz who died in 1975. The other prize winners were: .

        "input_text": "A white supremacist who has been charged with three murders entered a plea of not guilty in court on Friday. Frazier Glenn Miller, 74, is charged with capital murder in the April 13, 2014, shootings at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City in Overland Park, Kansas, and at the nearby Village Shalom Retirement Center. Miller, also known as Frazier Glenn Cross, is a Vietnam War veteran from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. None of the victims of the 2014 shooting that took place on the eve of Passover, a week-long holiday in which the Jewish community celebrates their freedom from slavery in Egypt, were Jewish. Scroll down for video . Frazier Glenn Miller (above) entered a plea of not guilty for charges of capital murder in the killing of three individuals on April 13, 2014 . Miller, a supremacist, allegedly opened fire outside a Jewish community center in Overland Park, Kansas screaming 'Heil Hitler!' Miller (mugsghot above), who says he is ill and does not have much time to live, also asked for a speedy trial . On Friday, Frazier also asked for a speedy trial and to have Internet access while he is in prison. The judge granted him the right to a speedy trial, which will begin August 17, but denied him Internet access. Miller said he would go to trial in 30 days if he could represent himself. Overland Park police Sgt. Marty C. Ingram testified earlier this month at a preliminary hearing that he heard shots fired at the Jewish Community Center and saw the doors of the center's theater shatter. He said he took cover as more shots hit the building's facade back on April 13. 'Dust, smoke was flying everywhere at that point,' he said. The gunman then drove away. When he heard that fellow officers had arrested a suspect, Ingram accompanied some witnesses to the arrest scene to determine if they could identify him. As they approached the patrol car where Miller was detained, he shouted 'Heil Hitler!' and asked how many Jews he had killed. Miller is accused of killing Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, who were attending a singing contest audition at the community center. He also is accused of killing 53-year-old Terri LaManno, who was visiting her mother at the nearby Jewish retirement home. Miller (above in 80s) was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car . At a December hearing, Miller, who has emphysema, said he was afraid that he doesn't have much time left to live following a trip to the emergency room in March. Miller previously served three years in federal prison on weapons charges and for planning the killing of the Southern Poverty Law Center's founder. He was also arrested in 1986 when he was caught with a male prostitute dressed as a woman in the back of his car.",

        "input_text": "The White House claimed today that the United States should be feared by ‘extremists’ in Yemen – even though the last remaining special forces have been evacuated from the country ‘because it is dangerous.' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that ISIS-linked groups will have American to deal with if they carry out more attacks in the war-torn country, which is split between Sunni and Shia Muslims. U.S. officials 'had to relocate from Yemen because its a dangerous country,' Earnest said Monday. 'But I'll tell you, that as of today, Yemen remains a dangerous country for extremists as well.' Earnest said there continues to be continues to be 'ongoing security cooperation' between the U.S. and the 'national security infrastructure' of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whose power has been crippled in recent months after Shia rebels initiated a coup-d'etat. The U.K. also pulled its special forces out of the country, following the United States' lead, leaving Hadi and his loyalists to face extremist and rebel threats to the country on their own. Tribal militiamen loyal to Yemeni President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi stand on a tank positioned in the southern city of Lahj on Monday. The militiamen have reportedly been deployed around the city of Lahj, along the border with Taiz city which was captured one day ago by Shiite Houthi rebels. Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi has called on his supporters to mobilise towards the south of Yemen . Yemeni protesters shout slogans and set alight tires during clashes following a protest against the Houthi takeover of several state facilities in the central city of Taiz, Yemen, on Monday. According to local reports a day after Houthi rebels took over the strategic central city of Taiz, capturing several state facilities including the city's airport, airbase and a court complex, residents took to the streets to protest their presence . In pushing back against claims that the U.S. is flying blind in Yemen now that it's 'temporarily relocated' its special forces the president's spokesman assured reporters that the the country 'continues to have assets and resources in the region that will allow us to take steps where necessary to continue to apply pressure necessary to extremist targets and to keep the American people safe.' House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul had said a day before on ABC News program this week that the result of the complete withdraw is that 'we will have no intelligence footprint or capabilities to monitor' what Sunni al Qaeda affiliates, known in the country as AQAP, ISIS and Shia 'militants are doing in the region.' 'Good intelligence stops plots against the homeland,' he said. 'Without that intelligence, we cannot effectively stop it, that’s what I’m most concerned about.' Earnest said Monday afternoon that its 'true' that he US would be a 'more effective' force against extremists if military personnel were still in the country - but it 'doesn't mean that coordination has been eliminated.' The White House said it has proven its ability to fight threats in other countries, including Syria and Somalia, without troops on the ground and it will do the same in Yemen. The U.S, has already shown that it will take extremists 'off the battlefield in Yemen when they pose a threat to the United States.' 'Those efforts continue, and our capability to carry out those kinds of actions persists to this day as well.' Yemenis carry a coffin during a funeral for the victims of Sanna Mosque Attacks  in Sanaa, Yemen, on Monday. The Yemeni people held a funeral for those who were killed in suicide bombing attacks in Sanaa on Friday. The Islamic State says it launched the bombing attacks that killed at least 154 people and wounded 350 others but the White House disputes that the terrorist group was involved . Yemenis and members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene of a suicide attack on Saturday in Yemen . U.S. officials 'had to relocate from Yemen because its a dangerous country,' U.S. President Barack Obama's chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, said on Monday. 'But I'll tell you, that as of today, Yemen remains a dangerous country for extremists as as well.' The remarks follow the United States' removal on Saturday of special forces from the country . The White House's insistence that its counter terror strategy in Yemen, which the president propped up as a success story last year, and the region is still effective came after the country's security situation took a turn for the worse over the weekend. On Friday four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 people and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country. A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but the White House said Monday it has not seen evidence to support the group's claims. More likely, it said, is that ISIS is taking credit for the assault 'merely for propaganda value,' not because it had any direct involvement. Hundreds of members of al Qaeda also managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday. In addition, Shia rebels that have taken over large parts of the country, the Houthis, issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight Yemenis loyal to embattled President Hadi. The U.S. and U.K. responded to the disturbances by recalling special forces from the country. CNN reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among personnel who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and have since been sent out of the country. The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization al Qaeda, AQAP, in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris. Members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of Friday's suicide bombings . Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. The Houthis are a Shia group that earlier this year gained power in the country after taking over the government in a struggle that some believe was funded by Iran. The White House says it does not know how much support Iran is providing the Houthis but it does not appear to be controlling their operational movements. In January of this year, the Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. It was at that point most Americans were ushered out the country and the embassy was shuttered. The Houthis launched a new strike against Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital. That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi following a speech he gave, one of his first in weeks, in which he accused rebels of carrying out 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy.' He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of Riyadh and announced a plan to place a national flag in the city of Sa'dah, the Houthi base. Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country. Sunday the United Nations' special envoy for Yemen to the international organization's security council that the country was on 'the edge of civil war. 'Following the suicide bombings and fighting, emotions are running extremely high, and unless a solution can be found in the coming days the country will slide into further violent conflict and fragmentation,' the envoy, Jamal Benomar, said. Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yaseen on Monday reportedly asked the country's neighbors to help the government fend off rebels militarily. Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi delivers a speech calling for unity on Saturday . Hundreds of Yemenis chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings on Saturday . The White House reaffirmed its belief on Monday that Hadi is 'the rightful leader of Yemen' and pointed to a United Nations statement issued over the weekend that echoed the policy position. The U.S., Earnest said, hopes along with the international community that the Houthis will stop their rampage 'and participate in the UN-led effort to try to resolve the differences of all the parties there.' Asked if the U.S. had plans to designate the Houthis as a terrorist group, Earnest directed reporters to the State Department. 'What we have been focused on are the serious concerns that we have about the destablizing activity of the Houthis,' he said of the president's advisers, and 'we could encourage both sides, including the Houthis, to put an end to the violence and come to the negotiating table.' Should they decide to participate in the peace process, Earnest said the U.S. and the U.N. would be involved 'so that we can end the bloodshed, that we can end the violence, and try to bring some stability to this nation that's been racked by so much instability over the years.'",

Wossen Assaye, 42, allegedly stole two cars in Virginia before he was recognized by a passerby and apprehended getting off a Metrobus  in southeast D.C.  at 11.30am on Tuesday. He was wearing a hospital gown under street clothes and still had on an ankle chain when he was taken into custody without incident, a source told WUSA9. Assaye had escaped the Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church at 3am. He had been receiving treatment for a broken nose at the hospital after trying to hang himself in his Alexandria City Jail cell last week following his arrest for a series of of bank robberies on March 20. Scroll down for video . Found: Wossen Assaye, left, overpowered a guard at Inova Fairfax Hospital on Tuesday and a massive search was launched. He was tracked down in Washington D.C. about eight hours after his escape . Police had hired a private security company to guard the shackled 42-year-old while he was at the hospital,  but he managed to overpower a female guard while a male guard went to the restroom. During a scuffle, one shot was fired but it is not clear who pulled the trigger. No one was hurt. The hospital was put on lockdown as hundreds of officers searched for him. But the lockdown was lifted after a woman reported being carjacked several miles away around 7am. It emerged that Assaye had fled from the hospital to a nearby residential neighborhood and had broken into the trunk of her car, police said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. When she got in the car and started driving, Assaye kicked through the back seat and forced her out of the vehicle. Terrified, she crashed the car into a nearby home and got out. The man, who took off in the vehicle, was wearing a hospital gown, she told police after fleeing to a nearby gas station for help. Her car - a 2002 Toyota Camry - was later found on a street nearby with the female guard's stolen firearm inside, police said. Assaye then allegedly stole a second vehicle, a dark gray Hyundai Elantra with Virginia plate XTU-5024, which authorities are still trying to locate. Scene: Assaye had been at Inova Fairfax hospital (pictured) early on Tuesday for treatment after harming himself while in jail. He had been arrested on March 20 in connection with a series of bank robberies . Hunt: A Virginia State Police officer hunts for the accused bank robber in Fairfax after his escape . Dramatic: An officer from the U.S. Marshals fugitive task force hunts for Assaye on Tuesday morning . Crash: After carjacking a vehicle, Assaye allegedly drove across this resident's lawn on Cindy Lane in Annandale - near to the hospital - and smashed into this parked car, its owners said . Police said he also changed into regular street clothes - a dark colored jacket and blue jeans. As they searched for him, Fairfax Police called Assaye 'armed and dangerous'. They initially said he may be with his girlfriend and released her photo early  but later determined that was not the case. But when he reached Washington D.C., he was seen by a civilian who recognized him from media coverage and called authorities. Assaye was then apprehended. Police released this image of his girlfriend and said they may have been together - but they were not . Authorities said they continue to investigate how he managed to get out of his shackles. Assaye had been arrested on March 20 charged with a robbery at Apple Federal Credit Union in Alexandria. But in a court document, an FBI agent suggests Assaye is responsible for a string of 12 bank robberies in northern Virginia over the last year and a half. In court documents about the robberies, the FBI agent said the robber seen in surveillance photographs and video recordings is 'physically similar' in the dozen robberies and the one at the Apple Federal Credit Union. In all, the banks were robbed of approximately $32,000. In most cases, the agent said the robber entered the bank with a cellphone to his ear, demanded money and fled with cash on a bicycle. Following his March 20 arrest, Assaye was booked into the William G. Truesdale Adult Detention Center in Alexandria and remained there until he tried to take his life on Friday. Alexandria deputy sheriffs maintained custody of Assaye for the first 24 hours before turning him over to security officers contracted by the U.S. Marshals, Alexandria Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Amy Bertsch said. Following his escape, police locked down the hospital and closed nearby roads to search for him and asked people in the area to call police with information about anything suspicious. The lockdown at the hospital, which is  10 miles southwest of Washington D.C., was lifted at 8am. Caught: Assaye, 42, has a long rap sheet and is now accused of robbing 12 banks of $32,000 . Armed: A Virginia State Police officer is pictured hunting for the accused bank robber before he was caught . Task force: Virginia State Police, U.S. Marshals and FBI agents searched neighborhoods after his escape . Search: Fairfax County Police stand guard outside the hospital as the manhunt got underway . Schools in the area are on spring break. Kent Knoff, a worker at a nearby Exxon, told NBC that police had swarmed the area. 'There are police cars everywhere,' he said. 'We've been having the door locked and got a message from police to stay inside.' Assaye has an 'extensive criminal record' and 'history of violence,' indicating a 'serious risk to the community', according to a 2012 Virginia Parole Board document seen by NBC. Records show he was convicted for snatching a purse in 1994 and given a recommended 12-month jail sentence and was accused of breaking and entering in 1998, NBC reported. His Facebook page says he lives in Arlington and studied at George Mason University in Fairfax.",

A UH-60 Black Hawk crashed in the Gulf of Mexico close to Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle on Tuesday night. The area  was under a fog advisory when the crash took place. Foggy conditions remained on Wednesday morning which was hampering the search, Eglin public affairs specialist Sara Vidoni said. A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that human remains had been found during the search but could not confirm the identities or number of people. Debris from the crash washed up on shore Wednesday, including landing gear and the side of the helicopter with the glass from the windows missing. Scroll down for video .

Thick fog: The are was under fog advisory when the crash took place. Military officials who spoke with Daily Mail Online says local pilots are used to the conditions but the pilot who was flying at the time was from Louisiana or North Carolina. Above, a file photo of a UH-60 Black Hawk - not the one that crashed . Hard to see: Military personnel wade in the water and search on the beach under heavy fog at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida on Wednesday . Evidence: A man walks the beach near where debris washed up Wednesday morning following the helicopter crash, and appears to be picking up remnants of the crash . While a Pentagon official said the men were presumed dead, the hunt for the crashed helicopter remains a search and rescue mission and not search and recovery. Base officials said the Marines were part of a Camp Lejeune-based, 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Jacksonville, North Carolina. The soldiers were from a National Guard unit based in Hammond, Louisiana. The massive Black Hawk has been the workhorse of the U.S. Army since 1979. They are primarily used to ferry troops to and from the battlefields, and support aircraft, but adapted models carry out medical evacuations with state-of-the-art equipment, search-and-rescue, armed escort and warfare missions. Black Hawks were a central part of the U.S. military attack on Somalia capital, Mogadishu in 1993. They were also used in military operations in the Balkan region and Haiti in the 1990s; and supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The aircraft has also been used prominently by the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq. There are manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft based in Stratford, Connecticut. It flies low to the ground to avoid detection and its twin-turbine engine can deliver a maximum speed of roughly 180mph. During an afternoon press conference, Major General Glenn Curtis of the Louisiana National Guard confirmed that all of his soldiers were male and that three had aided in the Hurricane Katrina response. He described his men as 'tremendous pilots' and 'tremendous soldiers' Two Black Hawks took off together from the base ahead of the crash on Tuesday night. It is unclear how many soldiers were on board the other aircraft. A military spokesperson told Daily Mail Online that training missions usually took off from Eglin on a daily basis and said that it was up to individual units whether to fly in adverse weather conditions such as heavy fog. Fog was common in the region, the spokesperson said, and local pilots were used to the conditions.  The pilot on the Black Hawk which crashed on Tuesday night was from either Louisiana or North Carolina. The helicopter was reported missing around 8.30pm on Tuesday and search and rescue crews found debris from the crash around 2am on Wednesday. Kim Urr, 62, who works at the nearby Navarre Beach campground, said she heard a strange sound, followed by two explosions around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday. 'It sounded like something metal either being hit or falling over, that's what it sounded like. And there were two booms afterward, similar to what you hear with ordnance booms, but more muffled,' Urr said. The tail rotor of the helicopter with its ID number was found during the rescue mission, according to military officials. Names of those involved were not immediately released, pending notification of next-of-kin. But Mike Spinks from Eglin Environmental Public Affairs told WKRG: 'There is always hope.' The Army helicopter took off from a nearby airport in Destin and joined other aircraft in the training exercise. The UH-60 helicopter went down during a routine training mission off a remote stretch of beach between Pensacola and Destin. Two helicopters were flying a night training mission, but only one of the helicopters returned. Above patrol boats search the waters near the crash site on Wednesday .

Seven Marines and four soldiers aboard an Army helicopter that crashed over waters off Florida during a routine night training mission were presumed dead on Wednesday . The search for the missing Black Hawk helicopter was being hampered by heavy fog in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday morning . The beach is owned by the military and is used for test missions. The training area includes 20 miles of pristine beachfront that has been under the control of the military since before World War II. Military police keep a close watch on the area and have been known to run off private vendors who rent jet skis or paddle boards without permission. Test range manager Glenn Barndollar said in August that the beach provides an ideal training area for special operations units from all branches of the military to practice over the water, on the beach and in the bay. The military sometimes drops trainees over the water using boats or helicopters and the trainees must make their way onshore. The black helicopter that crashed was a newer model that had a black box, which could shed light on what caused the crash if located. Military officials said on Tuesday night that the names of those involved were not immediately released following the crash off Eglin Air Force Base pending notification of next-of-kin .

Kerri Lawson, 18, put an appeal on Facebook when her Labrador Homer sneaked out of the garden of her family home in Washington, Tyne and Wear, and disappeared. Her despair initially turned to joy when she was told it had been found by a member of the public who took the animal, which had arthritis which makes him drag his back leg, to a vet. But she was then told by the vet that they had put Homer down because of his condition - without telling his devastated owner first. Kerri Lawson said she was distraught after she found her missing dog had been handed in by a member of the public to the vet, only for staff to decide to put the animal down - without informing her first . Ms Lawson said: 'Homer did have a few health problems, but he was not as bad as the vet said he was. 'They shouldn't have just gone ahead and done this without our say-so.' After Homer, who was 16-years-old, disappeared he was found by a member of the public and taken to Cestria Vets in Chester-le-Street. Vets said he was having trouble breathing and within 24 hours he was put to sleep. Ms Lawson believes the arthritis in his legs, which caused him to drag his back leg and look ill, was known to the vets after Homer was injured in an accident 12 years ago. The student added: 'The problems were known to the vet and they said it was completely fine and there was no need to worry. 'They should have contacted the dog warden at the council to tell them he had been handed in. 'They could have waited. That way, we would have known he had been found - we would have had a point of contact. Miss Lawson said her pet had arthritis in his legs, but claimed veterinary staff had known about his condition . 'We had no way of knowing he'd been taken to the vets.' Homer was not microchipped but Ms Lawson said he had a docked tail and cauliflower ear, making him more distinctive. He was also not wearing a collar. Veterinary staff said they were forced to take action after the Labrador was found 'thin and experiencing breathing difficulties.' A spokeswoman for the practice said staff take their responsibilities to animals very seriously and said it would not have been ethical for them to have admitted such an unwell animal, thought to have been a stray, in such a 'desperate' condition. She added: 'Our obligation to stray animals is to provide such emergency treatment and pain relief as is appropriate and we treat many strays each year, before either successfully reuniting them with their owners, or passing them on to the relevant authorities. The dog was taken to Cestria Veterinary Centre in Chester-le-street, where the dog was then put down . 'Homer was brought in on Saturday morning by a member of the public. We checked our 'lost' register, in which we record details of missing animals reported to the surgery, but found no matching entry. 'We did not attempt to contact the dog warden, as we had previously been informed that they did not operate at weekends. 'The police no longer have legal responsibility for stray dogs and do not maintain a list.' The woman said the animal was examined by two veterinary surgeons who found he was agitated and distressed. Microchipping dogs is to become compulsory by April 2016, along with ensuring all details stored on the microchip are updated. Owners who don't comply can be fined £500. Recent research by the Dogs Trust found that 57 per cent of owners do not realise microchipping will become a legal obligation in 12 months time. They also found 46 per cent of British dog owners do not update their animal's microchip with address details when they move. This is in spite of 22 per cent of owners admitting their dogs strayed within 48 hours of them moving to a new area. The Dogs Trust estimate there are 1,780,000 dogs in the UK who are not microchipped. Around 72 per cent of dog owners are unaware that they only have seven days to recover a missing dog from a Local Authority before they are rehomed or put to sleep. 'Obviously elderly, he was making clawing, repetitive movements of his front legs, but was unable to stand, even when supported and was barely responsive to his surroundings,' she added. 'His lung and heart sounds were muffled and indistinct, he was very thin and was experiencing breathing difficulties. 'They decided that his condition was terminal and considered his prognosis hopeless. 'No palliative treatment could have been provided which would have rendered his condition comfortable, and accordingly he was painlessly put down. 'It is not acceptable, either legally or ethically, for us to admit a stray animal in such a desperate clinical condition to the hospital, in the hope that an owner comes forward. 'It is always with deep regret that we take this drastic action, which is only done to prevent further suffering, but these few unfortunate animals are put down with a gentle touch and a kind word. 'His owners have our deepest sympathy.'",

        "input_text": "Police sought answers Wednesday from a retired correction officer after his dispute with a pair of strangers ended with a fatal shooting. Former officer, Willie Groomes, 69, shot Gilbert Drogheo at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Borough Hall station in Brooklyn, police said. Drogheo's uncle declared Groomes to be 'a murderer' on Wednesday night. Scroll down for video... Killed: Victim Gilbert Drogheo, 32, was killed after a scuffle on the 4 train on Tuesday night . Altercation: Cell phone footage taken by a witness and shared with CBS New York shows an older man approaching a younger man at the subway station and getting into a scuffle before a shot is heard . Terrifying: A blurred figure can be seen near to where the altercation occurred on Tuesday evening . He said that his nephew was a dedicated electrician. 'He was a great kid,' the uncle said. 'All he did was work,' he told the Daily News. Investigators took Groomes into custody on Wednesday but later released him without charges. The shooting  spread panic inside a subway station at the height of the evening rush hour when the retired officer, who's 69 years old, boarded a Brooklyn-bound subway train in Manhattan. He was armed with a small Ruger handgun that he was licensed to carry in public. According to witnesses, it appeared that the former officer angered Drogheo, 32, and another man by stepping in between them while they were talking, police said. Emergency: Ambulances carry away an injured man; Gilbert Drogheo was pronounced dead in hospital after he was shot in the torso and the ex-corrections officer was taken away for treatment for a minor injury . The men and the officer argued before they pushed him down into an empty seat on the train, police said. All three men exited the train at the next stop in Brooklyn, where there was a second confrontation on the station's mezzanine level, police said. The retired officer tussled with Drogheo before pulling his weapon and firing one round, which struck the victim in the chest, they said. New York Police Department officers assigned to the station heard the gunshot and quickly detained the shooting suspect. Drogheo, who was from Harlem, died at a hospital. The other man was taken into custody. Television station WCBS broadcast a cellphone video showing a man it identified as the retired officer cornering a smaller man near an exit in the subway station and pushing him. The men are seen struggling before a gunshot is heard and bystanders scatter. Subway passenger Thomas Berry, who witnessed the dispute, told the Daily News the older man had initially tried to avoid trouble. Rush hour shooting: A 32-year-old man was fatally shot by a retired corrections officer during the shooting . Deadly confrontation: Witnesses said the fight began when the older man stepped between two men . The officer told the other two men, ''Leave me alone. Don't talk to me,'' Berry said. 'He was being really calm.' But as the dispute grew more heated, the older man flashed a gun, Berry said. 'Everyone said 'gun' and ran off the train,' he said. 'I was standing there in shock.' A cell phone video obtained by CBS New York revealed the moment the officer allegedly shot and fatally wounded Drogheo. The two exchange words and the older man apparently pushes the younger man, the video shows. Just seconds later, a shot is heard. Drogheo was shot in the torso. Other images captured by witnesses and shared with NBC show a man on the ground. He was rushed to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. Fight: The 69-year-old gunman was reportedly heard telling his opponents, 'don't touch me' before the brawl . Tempers flare: The 69-year-old former jail guard got on the crowded train at Bowling Green station and was trying to walk past the duo when some words were exchanged . Witnesses described the chaotic scene after hearing the gunshot ricochet through the station during one of the busiest travel times of the day. Fatima Manuel told CBS she was confused by the sound at first. 'Like a 'pow, pow' sound,' she said. 'Sounded like a firecracker, but then I said: 'No, that's not a firecracker. That's more like a gunshot'.'. Another subway user, Donny Dushi, added: 'It's the scariest thing to even hear about. Wherever you are in the city - regardless if it's Brooklyn, the city, Queens, just knowing the transportation you take every day, it can happen to anybody.'",

The aim of stripping the property for the sale was to attract a buyer who can stamp their personality on it. The gamble worked. Mr Fung had to beat six other bidders to buy the massive four-floor apartment on the Gold Coast. The apartment with its own opulent pool, luxury fittings and a massive stainless steel barbeque, became Australia's most expensive penthouse, in 2006 when an agreement was reached to sell it for nearly $17 million. But the deal with Brisbane businessman Charlie Caltabiano fell through and receivers were brought in following a legal dispute. Since then, the penthouse has been stripped of every piece of furniture, every fitting, the walls, the ceiling and even the kitchen sink. Scroll down for video . Gutted. The living area is unrecognisable from its once grand appearance, all fittings and furnishings have been removed, even exposing the air conditioning unit - the incredible 360 view of the Gold Coast, though, is still the same . The previous fit-out is long gone as the Soul Penthouse prepares to go under the hammer . The Soul Penthouse is one of the stand-out buildings along the Gold Coast skyline . The 63-year-old Hong Kong businessman is no foreigner to expanses in need of some love. He is planning to develop an $8.15 billion 'Aquis' casino and resort in Yorkey's Knob, Cairns, causing much controversy among locals. McGrath agent James Ledgerwood told The Courier Mail that this high profile buyer will attract a lot of attention to the Soul building. 'Given the new owner and his expectations, it's safe to say it will become one of the icons of penthouses in Australia.' Ledgerwood also added that spaces like this one are unique due to their versatility. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' James Ledgerwood admitted. The interior as shown in a catalogue is in stark contrast to what is there today awaiting Mr Fung's personal touch . Today: The bare bones living area. 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we stripped it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floors and the kitchen too' Mr Ledgerwood of selling agents McGrath told Daily Mail Australia . 'It's similar to buying a vacant house lot, but 220 metres up in the sky and with the highest swimming pool in Queensland,' he said. A spokesperson for Mr. Fung said that he was ecstatic with the recent purchase. 'It is a vote of confidence in the Queensland economy and an important addition to his property holdings in the state,' he said. Fung already owns 447 hectares worth of properties in the Gold Coast hinterland as well as an Innisfail farm, a private golf course in Noosa and he purchased Casino Canberra in December. Agent James Legerwood had previously told Daily Mail Australia that this property was a rare gem, particularly on the Gold Coast in Australia. He and co-partner John Natoli were brought in, with a clear brief, take whatever measures are needed to sell it. All cupboards and fixtures have been removed from the 'old Aurora'. It's been gutted after the $17 million sale fell through . McGrath Broadbeach selling agent James Ledgerwood. He says the new appeal of this four-level 1040 square metre property 'is that it is very, very rare that anyone gets a chance to put a penthouse together the way they want, particularly here on the Gold Coast' As it once was. The luxurious pool-side look (above) has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version (below) shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . As it is now. The luxurious pool-side look has gone to make way for a new look from new owners. The current version shows Queensland's highest positioned pool and spa, but little else . They took one look at the apartment which set a record when sold at $16.85m in 2006 and decided to get rid of the old fit-out . 'Look, we had to admit that it (the fit-out) that was there was not very appealing, so we decided that it needed to be ripped up.' 'It's unique, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for buyers - we want to sell this penthouse, so we began by stripping it right back to a shell, that includes the limestone floor and the kitchen too,' Mr Ledgerwood added. The Soul Penthouse starts on level 70 and winds its way up four levels. 'There's not much left from how we found it,' he said. At least the BBQ is still in place. One of the biggest talking points all along for the Soul Penthouse has been the swimming pool and spa area, the highest of their kind anywhere in Queensland . Eight car spaces are provided down below and even that area had been cleared out prior to the auction . However, Ledgerwood added it had some serious appeal. It's position at more than 220 metres above the ground, four levels (70-73), boasting 'the highest swimming pool and spa in Queensland', no less than eight secure basement car spaces (which have also had fittings removed) and 'full resort facilities including pools, gym and gardens'. 'This will give them (buyers) the opportunity to create their own vision and take advantage of some of the most spectacular views in Australia, and create a residence of world-class standing.' he said. 'You have spectacular views - out to the Hinterland to the west, you look east out to the ocean, then up to Stradbroke (Island) in the north and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice.' The auction that saw Tony Fung one more Australian property richer, took place on March 7. Dream views. 'You look up to Stradbroke (Island) and all the way down to Coolangatta down south, to be fair the previous lay-out did not do that justice' said Mr Ledgerwood .

Last year, Preshalin Moodley, 20, was issued a provisional driver's licence by staff at Service NSW Parramatta, in Sydney's west. He was photographed for the licence wearing the spaghetti strainer on his head after asking staff whether it was OK to wear a religious symbol. Preshalin Moodley, 20, was issued a provisional driver's licence last year while wearing a spaghetti strainer on his head, which he said is a symbol of his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti monster. 'I put my colander on. She just stared at me, didn't say anything,' Mr Moodley recalled . In an apparent poke at organised religion, Pastafarians say they believe in the 'spaghetti monster' and adherents say their religion is as legitimate as any other. Mr Moodley received a letter from Service NSW last Tuesday, March 3, and was informed he would have to have his licence reissued so a 'photograph can be retaken without any item on your head'. 'Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) have advised that this photograph does not meet the current requirements, as you were wearing a colander on your head,' the letter to Mr Moodley said. 'The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is not a recognized (sic) religion and as such the wearing of the colander in this photograph does not meet current requirements.' It warned 'further action may taken' if he failed to comply. Mr Moodley is pictured here with a plastic colander on his head. A 'Pastafarian', the western Sydney resident has started an online petition requesting Roads Minister Duncan Gay . Mr Moodley, a science student at the University of Western Sydney, said he was 'frustrated' and surprised by the demand and has pledged to fight the ruling. 'They don't do this to any other religion,' he said. His supporters have started an online petition calling for Pastafarians to be allowed to 'wear their religious headwear and observe their religion as they see fit'. 'Even though it looks like a joke and (that) we're trying to take the mickey out of them, we're completely serious,' Mr Moodley said. 'To an outsider who doesn't know our goals, we look like a bunch of crazy people wearing colanders, eating spaghetti, and drinking beer. 'We're completely serious about what we're doing and I would not go this far for a practical joke. We really want Pastafarianism to be treated as equally as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, etc. Mr Moodley secured media attention after managing to obtain his license with the colander on his head last year. 'When it came to getting my photo done, I asked if religious headwear was allowed in the photo. She (the staff member) said yes. 'I put the colander on. She just stared at me didn't say anything. I put it on and that was it.' This a popular artistic interpretation of the so-called 'Flying Spaghetti Monster', who is hailed as a diety in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster - which is generally seen as a light-hearted parody of religion . A Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman confirmed this letter, sent to Mr Moodley, was legitimate. 'Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster movement, known as Pastafarians, are not part of a religion recognised in NSW or other areas of Australia,' a Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman said. 'For facial recognition security reasons, colanders must therefore be removed before licence photos can be taken' A Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman confirmed Mr Moodley was sent the letter. 'Religious headwear can be worn in driver licence photographs for recognised religions,' the spokeswoman said. 'Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster movement, known as Pastafarians, are not part of a religion recognised in NSW or other areas of Australia.

Johnston was sentenced to three years in prison in 2009 for dealing OxyContin after she sold the pills three times to undercover officers. The actual arrest happened while her son was dating Palin, who was pregnant, and whose mother was campaigning for vice president. 'They couldn’t even get a loan for a small camper to live in temporarily. That was their first plan, but four banks denied them,' said a source close to the family. 'They’re not being welcomed with a warm greeting but what choice does his mom have — leave her grandkids homeless?'

        "input_text": "The end of the hated annual tax return will be signalled by the Chancellor today. George Osborne will use his last Budget before the General Election to unveil digital tax accounts for millions who currently have to complete self-assessment forms. They will work like online bank accounts and keep an up-to-the-minute record of all the tax someone owes or has paid. George Osborne will unveil digital tax accounts for millions in his Budget today . New digital tax accounts are designed to end hassle for individuals but also boost business by significantly cutting down on red tape. Individuals and firms can already choose to fill in their annual tax return online, but this is simply the paper form on a website. Once a year, and a year behind, taxpayers have to send HMRC information it already holds on income – meaning many people end up with tax affairs that are out of date and incorrectly coded. They have only one opportunity a year to interact with tax officials to reconcile their account and notify them of any change of circumstances. The digital accounts will allow such updates at any time. It will mean users can see all the taxes they need to pay without having to complete a tax return, and pay taxes they owe when it suits them – by linking to their bank account so they can pay in instalments or by direct debit, for instance. There will be particular advantages for businesses, which currently have to pay different taxes at different times, including VAT, corporation tax, income tax and National Insurance. By early 2016, all five million small businesses and the first ten million individuals will have access to digital tax accounts. All businesses in the UK and 55million individuals will have one by the end of the next Parliament. Those who have difficulty gaining access to the internet will continue to be allowed to submit paper returns, or be offered support. Officials claim the system will cut the time it takes to complete tax returns from an average of 40 minutes to just ten minutes a year. The accounts will allow tax to be paid at any time and will radically simplify the payment of various levies for businesses. Because the system will be automatically updated with information from employers, pension providers or banks, taxpayers will not have to submit duplicate information about their income. The populist reform is the centrepiece of an intensely political Budget. Mr Osborne will hail the Government’s economic record, saying 1,000 jobs a day have been created during its time in power – more than the rest of the EU combined. The Chancellor will seek to frame the choice facing voters as one between an economic plan that is working but only half complete, and the ‘chaos’ of a weak Labour government. Other Budget announcements are expected to include: . The Chancellor is expected to say: ‘The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let’s work through the plan that is delivering for you? ‘Today we make that critical choice: we choose the future. We have a plan that is working – and this is a Budget that works for you.’ Falling inflation and lower borrowing costs are expected to slash the Chancellor’s projected borrowing bill by around £20billion over the next five years. Officials claim the online system will cut the time it takes to complete tax returns from an average of 40 minutes to just ten minutes a year . Better-than-expected borrowing forecasts mean that by the end of the next Parliament, Mr Osborne is expected to have £10billion a year to play with if the Tories remain in power. This would allow him to fund his commitment to raise the income tax threshold further to £12,500, and the 40p rate threshold to £50,000 by 2020. But officials insist there will be no debt-funded ‘giveaways’, saying any tax breaks must be paid with public spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere. The Chancellor says he will raise £5billion in the next Parliament by cracking down on tax avoidance, including a new ‘Google tax’ to stop big multi-national firms shifting profits around in efforts to avoid paying tax in the UK. The lifetime allowance of tax-free pension savings is likely to be cut from £1.25million to £1million – as revealed in the Mail this month. The move would jeopardise Labour’s plans to use cuts to pension tax relief to fund a reduction in student tuition fees to £6,000 a year. Savings of up to £40,000 a year qualify for tax relief with a limit of £1.25million over the lifetime of a pension pot. Above this, a tax of 55 per cent applies.

        "input_text": "Hillary Clinton's emails won't likely turn up many insights about the 2012 Benghazi terror attacks, according to a onetime Clinton confidant, because she can't type. Dick Morris, who helped President Bill Clinton navigate domestic policy and led his 1996 re-election effort before imploding in his own 'bimbo eruption' scandal, wrote Monday on his blog that Mrs. Clinton 'doesn’t know how to type.' 'That’s right. She writes everything out in longhand. Really. Anyone who has spent time in meetings with her knows about her endless yellow pads.' Morris' insights, although dated, came as the former secretary of state visited the White House for a rare sit-down with President Barack Obama. Hillary Clinton visited the White House on Monday and tweeted this old photo of her hugging President Obama, while a former aide to her husband compared her email scandal to the Watergate tapes and said the Obama team likely created it to torpedo her chances in 2016 . PRESSURE: Clinton is facing tough questions about what's on a private email server that hosted all her emails for the four years she spent as America's top diplomat . Former Clinton insidder Dick Morris has turned against Hillary, dishing dirt about her past and suggesting what her weak spots might be . 'Her emails will most likely turn out to be very short and quick,' he predicted. 'She wouldn’t spend a lot of time pecking out long letters. No way. That’s why the Benghazi Committee needs to also look very closely at the emails on private accounts that Hillary’s closest aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, maintained.' 'Anything more than a few lines were most likely written by someone else on her behalf,' Morris continued. 'There’s a reason why Hillary set up and used private emails with them for official business: all the important emails were likely written by her staff. Without access to them, we won’t know what was going on.' A congressional panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding a 2012 terror attack on State Department facilities in Benghazi, Libya, while Clinton was secretary of state. The revelation that she exclusively used a private email account – otuside the control or automatic archiving of the Obama administration – has fed Republican accusations that she hid her involvement in a post-attack cover-up in the weeks before the 2012 election. At least two aides, Mills and Abedin, used personal email accounts on Clinton's private server, kept at her Chappaqua, New York home. Clinton's hour-long White House visit on Monday followed her appearance on a Washington, D.C. domestic policy panel hosted by the far-left Center for American Progress, and before she headlined an awards ceremony for journalists. She took no questions from reporters at the evening event, even though her unauthorized private email server has dominated news coverage, her aides are under subpoena and she is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming weeks. At the earlier liberal event, she endorsed a German-style system of subsidies to companies so they would keep more people employed. 'President Obama and Secretary Clinton enjoy catching up in . person when their schedules permit,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday in a cryptic statement to reporters. 'This afternoon they met privately for about an hour at the . White House and discussed a range of topics.' Moments after the White House confirmed the meeting, Clinton tweeted an old photo of her hugging Obama in the White House Situation Room. The president has had a frosty relationship with his former top diplomat since 2008 when thetwo squared off for the Democratic presidential nomination. IT'S THE AIDES, STUPID! Email accounts of former State Department Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills (left) and her top deputy Huma Abedin (right) are where Benghazi-related emails likely lurk, says Dick Morris . THE ADDRESS: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Clinton damaged his ambitious quest for the brass ring by starting the rumors that he was born in Kenya and lacked a valid U.S. birth certificate. The resulting conspiracy theories have dogged his presidency since Day One. Clinton's Twitter message, though, defended key provisions of the president's signature health insurance overhaul, which was an extension of her own failed attempt at reform while her husband was president. 'Repeal those things? Embrace them!' she tweeted. Morris has a checkered past. He famously resigned from Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign two months before Election Day after it was revealed that he paid a prostitute for sex and let her listen in on his phone calls with the president. His most recent star turn came with a lengthy Fox News Channel contract which wasn't renewed after he spectacularly blew his forecast for the 2012 presidential contest. Mitt Romney, the once famous pollster predicted, would coast to victory and unseat Obama. But Morris has been a thorn in Hillary's side since being bounced from her orbit in 1996. YUK-YUK: Clinton joked about her email scandal on Monday night at a journalism award dinnner: ''No more secrecy, no more zone of privacy. After all, what good did that do me?' When she ran for president in 2008, he penned a vicious 'fact check' article claiming that her 'main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent.' 'Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party,' for a year after her college graduation, he wrote. And 'she flunked the DC bar exam and only passed the Arkansas bar.' Morris did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But he said Sunday on a New York talk radio program that 'when we talk about \"Will Hillary survive the email scandal?\" – it’s just like asking in 1973 and 74, \"Will Nixon survive the Watergate tapes?\"' 'By delaying the day of reckoning' for all her private emails, he said, 'she's risking shipwrecking not just her candidacy, but the entire [Democratic] Party.' 'I think Obama wants [Elizabeth] Warren, not Hillary,' Morris added. 'I think the reason the email scandal got released to the newspapers by the administration was because they wanted to torpedo Hillary.'",

Lindsay Kannitha Souvannarath, 23, of Illinois and Randall Steven Shepherd made a brief appearance in court on charges of conspiracy to commit murder ahead of a preliminary hearing in April. The third alleged co-conspirator, James Gamble, 19, took his own life at home in Timberlea on February 13 ahead of the alleged planned shooting spree when police surrounded his house. Tight security and hand-cuffed: Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath arrives at court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in Canada on Tuesday . Tired: Lindsay Souvannarath and Randall Steven Shepherd are charged with conspiracy to commit murder, allegedly plotting a Valentine's Day mass shooting at the Halifax Shopping Centre . Police in Canada say the three planned to go on a shooting rampage at Halifax Shopping Center in Nova Scotia - before committing suicide. Souvannarath and Shepherd were also charged with conspiracy to commit arson, possession of weapons for a dangerous purpose and uttering threats via social media. They were both arrested at Halifax Stanfield International Airport after Souvannarath disembarked her flight from Chicago. Both defendants were stony faced and passive during their court appearance and neither spoke. Judge Brian Gibson told the court to reconvene on April 10 and heard that the pair have not applied for bail. Disheveled: Randall Steven Shepherd arrives at provincial court in Halifax on Friday ahead of his preliminary hearing in April . Indignity: Randall Steven Shepherd puts his hands on the wall to be handcuffed as he arrives in court . Impassive: Police say they foiled the alleged plot by three suspects to mark Valentine's Day by killing as many people as possible at the Halifax Shopping Center in Nova Scotia - and then committing suicide . Last month, tutors who taught Columbine-obsessed goth, Souvannarath, said she was a disturbed but talented writer. Souvannarath, 23, from Geneva, Illinois was arrested alongside Randall Steven Shepherd, 20, from Halifax, Nova Scotia, and charged with conspiracy to commit murder. College Professor Charles Aukema said: 'She knew how to put together a sentence and she had a command of detail. Sometimes, it was pretty sick detail.' According to the Chicago Tribune, Prof Aukema had Souvannarath as a student in 2012. Commenting on her writing style, Prof Aukema said: 'It's like a method actor trying to get into the mindset of a killer and then becomes a serial killer. I thought she was quite an introvert. It just seemed like she had no friends whatsoever.' Lindsay Kanittha Souvannarath was charged last month with conspiracy to commit murder. She made a brief court appearance on Friday . Back to jail: Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath leaves at court after a judge informed her and her alleged co-conspirator that their preliminary hearing was next month . No bail: Randall Steven Shepherd leaves court in Halifax on Friday amid tight security after his court appearance on Friday following his arrest on February 13 . Souvannarath admitted the massacre plot after her arrest at Halifax airport. A third suspect is believed to have shot himself after police surrounded his home in the Halifax suburb of Timberlea. It is understood that Souvannarath, Shepherd, and the third man, James Gamble had discussed their plans on the internet. Canadian media said that Gamble, 19, took his own life. Justice Minister Peter MacKay said: 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devestating. Mass casualties would have been a real possibility. 'This appeared to be a group of murderous misfits that were coming here, or living here, and were planning to wreak havoc and mayhem in our community.' Brian Brennan of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said three long-barrelled rifles had been recovered from Gamble's house. Lindsay Souvannarath, pictured, from Illinois was allegedly planning a massacre with two online Canadian friends . Souvannarath's writing is understood to be very disturbing and features stories about serial killers . Souvannarath posted about her admiration of Hitler, the Columbine killers and other murderers on her Facebook page, Tumblr site and forums, and even hinted at the deadly plan, writing last Wednesday: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down.' Two days after the post, she was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police received a tip. Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia was arrested on the same charges. A third suspect, James Gamble, 19 killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia, and a fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody. Online profiles show the named suspects had been exchanging unnerving messages for years. The dark messages come in stark contrast to Souvannarath's high school yearbook photo shared by the Kane County Chronicle, which shows a pretty teen. She went on to study at Coe College, where she studied English and creative writing before graduating last year. But online, Souvannarath, whose father is from Laos, painted herself as a neo-Nazi and regularly shared photos of Hitler while lauding white separatists, such as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Randal Steven Shepherd, pictured, went to the airport to collect Souvanarath who flew up from Illinois . 'Free speech is dead,' she apparently wrote in one forum in 2007, when she would have been just 15. 'That's why we need people like David Duke to bring it to life again.' Her Tumblr account is entitled 'c**kswastika', according to the Chronicle Herald. On the page, she displays a large pink swastika and links to James Gamble's Tumblr page, which shows images of Hitler, dead bodies and murders, and videos of the Columbine shooters. Gamble's page also features conversations that include graphic sexual descriptions as well as naked images of himself. 'I'm such a morbid f***ing freak,' he writes in one post. 'I love it.' Her Tumblr page also features images of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, including photos of their dead bodies, . Canadian police said they found three long-barrelled rifles at the home of James Gamble, pictured . James Gamble, pictured, is believed to have shot himself after his house was surrounded by police on Friday . 'Eric and Dylan are dead, but Reb and VoDKa live,' she wrote, apparently referring to Gamble. In one post from February 11, she shared a movie poster showing two ghoulish figures with the words: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' - perhaps hinting at their alleged plan for February 14. Beneath the poster she added: 'It's almost here. The clock is ticking.' She also shared quotes from murderers and photos of weapons. One picture shows a man holding a gun and wearing a t-shirt that reads: 'Natural selection.' Another post on her blog reads 'Saturday the 14th' in red, dripping letters with the comment: 'Ha Haa' written beneath. Her website is still showing new updates. Police said that she had pre-programmed online messages before she was due to carry out the attacks and ultimately kill herself.",

Now, friends of the family are opening up about the incident in an interview with People, revealing that Ashton spent every day after the incident at his brother's bedside and was in a complete state of shock that someone would murder his parents. Scroll down for video . Ashton Sachs (above) is charged with murdering his parents, Brad and Andra, then shooting his younger brother Landon, 8, leaving the young boy paralyzed and finally trying to kill his younger sister Lana . Ashton drove 18 hours straight from Seattle to his family's $2.5million luxury home  and said he spent 15 minutes pacing outside his parents' bedroom (Andra left, Brad right) deciding what to do before killing them . 'He would cry and say, \"Landon is 8 years old and he doesn’t have a dad,\"' said Sarah Verbeek, a former girlfriend. 'He'd say, \"I can't believe somebody killed my parents.\"' Ruth Briscoe, one of Andra's childhood friends, said that the first time she saw the young man after the tragedy; 'He collapsed on me crying. It was pretty powerful.' Ashton, who had no previous run-ins with the law, was arrested in March 2014 after police determined he was the 'lone suspect' in the murder. The found a semi-automatic in his car and phone records placed him in the area around the time. What still remains a mystery however is why he did it, especially to those who knew the young man. 'I don't have a reason why. Just a lot of problems,' Ashton initially told authorities. 'He never showed any signs of aggression or threatened to hurt someone,' said Verbeek. 'He wasn't that kid seen on TV crime documentaries that secludes himself and doesn't talk to anyone. He never spoke bad about his family. He never talked about guns. Nothing.' Two weeks after the shooting, Ashton and his brother Myles (right) filed for custody of their adopted siblings . It all happened in this home outside San Diego, California . In fact, many seem to think that only thing that is off-putting is how he behaved in the days after the incident. 'He talked about how he loved his parents,' said Andra's sister Lesley Summers. ''He said he'd had a dream that they weren't dead, and they drove up and Andra said, \"Bullets can't kill us.\"' Conor Ward, a friend, said; 'I think of my friend I loved, and I can't see the kid who murdered his parents.' Ashton drove 18 hours straight from Seattle to his family's $2.5million luxury home on February 9, 2013, and said he spent 15 minutes pacing outside his parents' bedroom deciding what to do before killing them. He then shot his adopted brother and sister, just swinging open their doors and firing as they lay in bed. Then, two weeks after the shooting, he and his brother Myles  filed for custody of those two children.

        "input_text": "Experts have abandoned an eight-day vigil for a wakeup call from the robot lander Philae, but remained hopeful the scout will revive as it rides on a comet nearing the Sun. Monitoring for the lander, which has been hibernating since November, will resume next month, the mission said. 'Perhaps it is still too cold for the Philae lander to wake up on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,' the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) said in a blog posted by the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA scientists have renewed efforts to contact the Philae lander on Comet 67p, shown in the illustration above . The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P. It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet. But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet. This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude. Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet. 'Maybe its power resources are not yet sufficient to send a signal to the team at the DLR Lander Control Center.' There has been no news of Philae for more than four months. That was when the battery ran down on the 100-kilogram (220-pound) lab after it bumped down in a rugged, shadowed part of the comet. Philae had just enough juice to carry out a 54-hour roster of core experiments before going into shutdown mode. The hope is that as the comet races towards the Sun, more light will bathe the probe's solar panels, enabling it to power up again and resume work. Its mother ship Rosetta sent down Philae on November 12 after a 10-year trek around the Solar System. It began to listen out for signals on March 12 as it launched a schedule of orbital swoops around the spot where Philae is believed to have landed. But there was only silence, and at 0400 GMT on Friday, Rosetta's communication unit was switched off, the ESA blog said. 'It was a very early attempt,' said DLR Project Manager Stephan Ulamec. 'We will repeat this process until we receive a response from Philae. We have to be patient.' Engineers saw an early chance in March when comet and lander were about 300 million kilometers (187 million miles) from the Sun, and the amount of solar radiation had nearly doubled compared to November. The next chance to receive a signal is during the first half of April, the blog said. Philae needs an internal temperature of more than minus 45 degrees Celsius (minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit) and at least five watts of power to automatically turn on. Until it can generate 19 watts, it cannot send signals to Earth via the orbiter. Philae has 10 instruments, including a drill, chemistry sets and imaging tools. It is the crowning feat in a 1.3-billion-euro ($1.4-billion) mission to unlock the secrets of comets, which some astrophysicists believe may have 'seeded' Earth with some of the ingredients for life. The Rosetta orbiter took a number of images of Philae as it bounced, with its final suspected resting place in the top right. However, further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe . Philae touched down on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November, but rather than landing softly, the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice. It first bounced to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then 65ft (20 metres) before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground. Blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air. Scientists described the comet's surface as being more like a trampoline, causing the probe to rebound so far. It is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site. The duck-shaped comet 67p/Churyumove-Geraismenko is moving closer to the sun and warming up as it does . This image sent back by the Philae lander shows one of its three feet next to what appears to be a cliff face . Scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership Rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe. Philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander. Before its batteries finally ran out, Philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images. Among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet's surface appears to be made of a very hard 'sintered' ice. This graphic shows how Philae bounced twice after it failed to anchor itself to the surface of the comet . Researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life. From several miles above the comet, Rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived. But there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander's solar panels. This would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board. The image above is a composite of four pictures taken by the Rosetta probe while flying 12 miles above the surface of the 2.4 mile wide comet 67p and shows the dramatic landscape that surrounds the Philea lander . Comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in August this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander. Philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least -45 degrees C before it can wake up. It will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up. Once awake, Philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the Rosetta orbiter. Koen Guerts, part of the Philae lander team at the DLR Control Centre, said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home. He said: 'Philae is designed so that, since November 2014, it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up.' 'At this time, we do not yet know that the lander is awake.To send us an answer, Philae must also turn its transmitter – and that requires additional power.' This blurry image captures the moment Philae bounced from the comet's surface after failing to anchor itself . Rosetta captured a mothership's view of Philae as it descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface . Philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication. Over the next eight days the Rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 flybys. Engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to optimise the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with Earth. Once Philae wakes up and can also transmit, it will first send data about its 'health' to Earth. The scientific work with the 10 instruments on board Philae also depends on these results. If sufficient energy cannot be stored in the battery, the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed. Currently, scientists believe that Philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys. Mr Ulamec added: 'Once we can communicate with Philae again, the scientific work can begin.'",

A former gas station employee and janitor in Vermont who died last June aged 92 had secretly amassed a fortune of around $8 million thanks to a hidden talent for picking successful stocks. Ronald Read's fortune only became public knowledge after his death when he bequeathed $6 million to his local library and hospital. During his lifetime Read was known to friends and neighbors as a man who sometimes held his coat together with safety pins and had a long-time habit of foraging for firewood. Read, who worked for almost 25 years at Haviland's service station in Brattleboro, was known for his flannel jacket and baseball cap. His most expensive possession was a 2007 Toyota Yaris valued at $5,000, which gave no hint of the size of his  fortune. 'If he could save a penny, he would,' Bridget Bokum, a senior associate at his local Wells Fargo Advisors office told WSJ. Bokum together with Claire Johns, the executor of Read's will, is currently going through a five-inch-thick stack of stock certificates to determine his exact worth. 'We all knew he was into the stock market, but not to this extent,' said Johns. The secret to Read's financial success was that a well as being a shrewd stock picker, he also displayed remarkable frugality and patience with his shares. At the time of his death Read owned at least 95 stocks, many of which he had held for decades. The secret to Read's success was that a well as being a good stock picker, he displayed remarkable frugality and patience with stocks including Procter & Gamble . He had invested across a variety of sectors, including railroads, utility companies, banks, health care, telecom and consumer products but had avoided technology stocks. When Read received dividend checks in the mail he plowed the money back into more shares, said Bokum. Among his longtime holdings were Procter & Gamble, J.P. Morgan Chase, General Electric and Dow Chemical. At the time of his death, Read also had large stakes in J.M. Smucker, CVS Health and Johnson & Johnson. His portfolio also included some notable failures including Lehman Brothers Holdings, which famously collapsed during the financial crisis in 2008. One of the keys for Read's success was that he was prepared to stick with his picks for long periods of time. In 1959 he bought 39 shares of Pacific Gas & Electric for about $2,380 and  they are now worth about $10,735. At the time of his death, he owned 578 shares in PG&E, worth just over $26,500. When Read died last year he also had large stakes in companies including Johnson & Johnson . Secret millionaire in their midst: Ronald Read, (left, in his trademark baseball cap), pictured eating Christmas Dinner at the American Legion in Vermont a few years before his death . Stepson Phillip Brown, of Somersworth, New Hampshire, told the Brattleboro Reformer that the only indication Brown had of Read's investments was his regular reading of the Wall Street Journal. 'I was tremendously surprised,' Brown said of Read's hidden wealth. 'He was a hard worker, but I don't think anybody had an idea that he was a multi-millionaire.' Read relied on subscriptions to The Wall Street Journal and Barron's for his investment knowledge, although he also made good use of his local library to which he has  bequeathed $1.2 million. He also donated $4.8 million to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and made a number of smaller bequests. 'It's pretty incredible. This is not something that happens on a regular basis,' said the hospital's development director, Gina Pattison. Gas station employee: Ronald  Read worked at Haviland's service station for 25 years and even met his wife there in 1960 for whom he was married for 10 years until she died in 1970 . This Google street view shows Ronald Read's modest home and that may even be him pictured in the right corner near his Toyota parked outside . Read was born in Dummerston in 1921. He was the first in his family to graduate from high school, walking and hitchhiking about four miles each way from his home to the high school in Brattleboro. After military service during World War II, he returned to Brattleboro where he worked at a service station for 25 years then worked for 17 years as a janitor at the local J.C. Penney. In 1960 he married a woman he met at the service station but she died in 1970.",

The  boys were identified as Yakob, 5, Moshe, 8, Yeshua, 10, and David, 12 while the girls were Sarah, 6, Rivkah, 11, and Elian, 15. The father Gabi Sassoon was at a religious retreat in Manhattan when the fire ripped through his home. The funerals will be held later today before the children's bodies are flown to Jerusalem tonight, where they will be buried. Scroll down for video . A Brooklyn blaze killed seven siblings, ages 5 to 14, and critically injured their sister, 15, and mother . The blaze began in the kitchen, when a hot plate that was left on, likely to keep food warm during the Sabbath without using the oven, caught fire . The victims include four boys ages 5, 6, 7 and 11, and three girls ages 8, 12, and 15 . Authorities have been unable to reach the father to tell him about the fire as he is out of the city at a conference . Hatzolah volunteers, known for their incredibly quick response time, arrived on the scene and helped treat the mother and her daughter . 'This is an unbelievable tragedy,' said Mayor Bill de Blasio (above) as he visited the scene . Fire investigators believe the blaze was caused by a hot plate that was left on to keep food warm for the Sabbath. 'This is the largest tragedy by fire that the city has had in seven years,' New York Fire Department Commissioner Daniel Nigro said during a Saturday morning news conference. 'It’s a tragedy for this family, it’s a tragedy for this community, it’s a tragedy for the city.' What's more, a neighbor said the children could be heard screaming 'Mommy, mommy help me' as the blaze took over the home. Firefighters received a call at 12:23am about the blaze at a single-family home in Midwood, a section of Brooklyn known for its low crime and large Orthodox Jewish population. More than 100 firefighters responded and brought the blaze under control at around 1:30am. Nigro said the blaze started in the kitchen, when a hot plate that was left on caught fire. He added that the plate was likely kept on as it is a way to keep food warm during the Jewish Sabbath without using the oven. During the Sabbath, most Orthodox families will not light fires. He then added; 'There was no evidence of smoke detectors on either the first or the second floor that may have alerted this family to the fire.' A smoke detector was found in the home's basement. The mother and eldest sister jumped out windows at the front of the house as soon as they saw the flames, which raced up the stairs to the second floor where the entire family was asleep, while the other children were trapped in their rooms in the rear. The mother tried to get the children but the blaze was too fierce, and after suffering serious injuries realized her only choice was to jump out the window to find help. 'My kids are in there, get them out! Get them out,' she screamed according to neighbors who spoke with the New York Post. Over 100 firefighters as well as Hatzolah worked to fight the fire and help the Orthodox Jewish family .

Damage can be seen along an upper floor on the back of the house . New York's Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro, center, walks inside the remains of the home . Mayor de Blasio hugs Fire Commissioner Nigro outside the scene of the fire . 'Firefighters forced their way in, extinguished fire on the first floor, which had started in the kitchen, then pushed upstairs and found the children in their bedrooms,' said Nigro. 'It’s difficult to find one child in a room during a search. To find a houseful of seven children that can’t be revived, I’m sure this will take a toll on our members for quite some time.' Neighbor Nate Weber said that he saw children being wheeled away on stretchers. 'I just turned away. I didn't even want to look,' he said. 'I heard a woman yelling: \"My kids are in there. Get them out! Get them out!\"' 'This is the largest tragedy by fire that the city has had in seven years,' New York Fire Department Commissioner Daniel Nigro said during a Saturday morning news conference .

The mother was taken to Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, while the teenage child that was critically injured was taken to Staten Island University Hospital. They were both suffering from burns and smoke inhalation. 'I don’t know if she makes it through this.

        "input_text": "Federal prosecutors could file corruption charges against New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez by the end of the week, ending a years-long saga that has had the Democratic politician livign and working under a shadow of criminal suspicion. The Wall Street Journal reported that the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would see charges filed in his native New Jersey, citing people familiar with the FBI's investigation. The allegations against Menendez involve claims that he used his office to promote the business interests of a Democratic Party donor and close friend in exchange for personal gifts. Menendez has denied any wrongdoing, vowing that he is 'not going anywhere.' But a grand jury probe that has lasted for two years coudl complicate his future. THE SENATOR: Sen. Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, may soon face criminal charges related to alleged corruption . POLITICS: (l-r) Menendez, donor Salomon Melgen, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her husband Paul, posed in February 2012 at a National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials gala . Menendez, 61, has seen pressure from the Obama administration over his positions on Cuba and Iran, leading some Republicans who share his foreign policy views to suspect that the White House is exacting retribution on him. But more troubling are the ethics questions lingering about Menendez's relationship with Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, a wealthy and prolific donor. The senator's aides admitted in 2013 that he had intervened a year earlier with the acting chief of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on his friend's behalf, pushing back against accusations of overbilling the Medicare system by $8.9 million. Menendez has also repaid Melgen $58,500 for the value of plane trips he took on the doctor's private jet, mostly to the posh Dominican Republic resot Casa de Campo. But his spokeswoman fiercely denied he has done anything illegal even as a conservative group is calling for him to resign and face the music. Tricia Enright, Menendez's communications director, told Daily Mail Online in a statement earlier this month that 'we believe all of the Senator's actions have been appropriate and lawful and the facts will ultimately confirm that.' 'Any actions taken by Senator Menendez or his office have been to appropriately address public policy issues and not for any other reason.' 'The Senator has counted Dr. Melgen as one of his closest personal friends for decades,' Enright said. 'The two have spent holidays together and have gone to each other’s family funerals and weddings and have exchanged personal gifts.' COY: Attorney General Eric Holder wouldn't talk on Friday about whether charges are forthcoming for Menendez, saying 'I can't comment' She called the investigation's beginnings 'suspect,' referring to 'false allegations' that have been 'discredited' in the past. Meanwhile, the conservative activist group American Commitment has called on Menendez to resign his office. On a new website called ByeBob.com, the group claims he 'unethically, and likely criminally, compromised his ability to represent the people of New Jersey.' CNN reported that the investigation into Menendez is reaching a crescendo, with prosecutors under pressure to complete their work before the statute of limitations runs out on some charges. Attorney General Eric Holder, according to the network, has already given his approval. But he insisted 'I can't comment on that' when a reporter asked him about the report Friday afternoon after Obama gave a speech in South Carolina. Menendez's first high-level meeting at HHS related to Melgen's Medicare troubles occurred on June 7, 2012, according to court documents seen by the New Jersey Law Journal. The government alleges that the senator and some of his staffers met with Marilyn Tavenner, who was then in charge of the agency's Medicare and Medicaid subagency. Court papers also indicate Menendez followup up the meeting with a phone call, and then took Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, who was then the Senate Majority Leader, to an August 2, 2012 meeting with the Department of Health and Human Services's then-secretary, Kathleen Sebelius. CNN reported that Melgen was one of the Medicare system's most-reimbursed doctors nationwide, during the years when he was also a major donor to Menendez and to the Majority PAC. That political action committee, run by former Reid staffers, collected more than $700,000 from Melgen and made sure $600,000 of it benefited Menendez’s re-election campaign. The senator, now the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman until two months ago, has become a thorn in the White House's side by taking positions that grate on President Obama. Menendez opposed the presdient's rapprochement with Cuban strongman Raul Castro, saying in December that his actions 'have vindicated the brutal behavior of the Cuban government.' He has stood in the way of the State Department's negotiations with Iran, threatening to lead Congress in imposing new sanctions on the Islamic Republic if it doesn't shelve its nuclear ambitions. The White House has insisted the Iranians can be trusted to keep their end of any bargain. 'I have to be honest with you,' Menendez said during a January 21 Capitol Hill hearing. 'The more I hear from the administration and its quotes, the more it sounds like talking points that come straight out of Tehran.' While he is not among the senate's super-rich elites, the New Jersey legislator will likely have the capital on hand to fight the charges: His legal defense fund has already collected, and spent, more than $1 million. Last week two of his Senate aides tried to avoid testifying before the federal grand jury in the case, arguing that the senator's actions, and theirs, are protected by the U.S. Constitution's 'Speech or Debate' clause. Those words in America's founding document shield federal lawmakers and their offices from executive branch scrutiny, including Justice Department investigations, while they are actively working on legislation. THE DOCTOR: Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida ophthalmologist and a major Menendez donor, was ordered to pay back Medicare for $8.9 million in overbillings, and Menendez intervened with HHS for him . SEARCH WARRANT: A January 30 raid of Melgen's medical practice yielded van-loads of boxes containing medical and billing records and computer files . According to the New Jersey Law Journal, aide Michael Barnard refused to answer 50 questions about Menendez's conversations with Sebelius and Tavenner, and also declined to talk to the grand jury about contact between the senator's office and Melgen's lawyer-lobbyist about those conversations. Another more senior aide, former Menendez chief counsel Kerri Talbot, reportedly refused to testify about a separate mattter. The grand jury wanted to know if Talbot had emailed a staffer at U.S. Customs and Border Protection to ask the agency to stop donating used port-screening equipment – principally cargo-container x-ray machines – to the Dominican Republic. Melgen, the senator's donor, controlled a company that offered similar equipment and wanted a contract proposal with the island nation to go through. The x-ray machines are used by customs and port security officials to screen cargo for narcotics and other contraband. NARCO-POLITICS: Dr. Melgen controlled a company that wanted a Dominican ports contract to sell x-ray equipment used to screen cargo containers for drugs. Menendez allegedly helped ensure the U.S. wouldn't provide the machines for free . In 2013 FBI agents and investigators from HHS raided Melgen's West Palm Beach, Florida medical office, Vitreo-Retinal Consultants. Over a period of nearly 24 hours, then executed search warrants and came out with dozens of boxes containing whatnews reports later described as medical and billing records and computer files. The Washington Post reported at the time that HHS auditors had raised red flags over the large number of eye surgeries and laser treatments Melgen's practice billed to Medicare. Other news reports described an alleged scheme in which Melgen used leftover fluid from single-use injection vials to treat two or three additional patients, billing Medicare for a new vial with each treatment. The government typically paid $2,000 for each container, raising the possibility that Melgen could have overbilled Medicare between $4,000 and $6,000 per vial.",

Sgt. William Mudd and Capt. Rick Henke resigned Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty was fired Wednesday. It is unclear whether the three were recipients or senders of the 'racially biased' emails included in the 102-page civil rights report released Wednesday by the DOJ  accusing the department of illegal practices targeting African-Americans. Twitty is seen in an undated photograph smiling as Darren Wilson, the Ferguson police officer who gunned down Michael Brown, an unarmed,  African-American teen, has his arm around her. The two are seen appearing joyful among colleagues and friends, including Ferguson Mayor James Knowles. Scroll down for video . Sgt. William Mudd (left) and Capt. Rick Henke (center) resigned from their positions Thursday and City Court Clerk Mary Ann Twitty (right) was fired Wednesday over racially charged emails discovered by the U.S. Justice Department during an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department . Friends: Here, Twitty is seen among friends and colleagues, standing next to Darren Wilson (center), the Ferguson officer who killed an unarmed black teen, Ferguson Mayor James Knowles appears in the photo as well (back left, wearing a green shirt) However, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Henke was associated with a 2008 email suggesting that President Barack Obama would not complete a full presidential term because a black man can't hold 'a steady job for four years.' Mudd is reportedly associated with a 2011 email suggesting a New Orleans woman was paid by 'CrimeStoppers' to terminate her pregnancy. The Justice Department highlighted several other emails in the report including one that featured a photograph of topless, appearingly tribal, women dancing, with the caption 'Michelle Obama's High School Reunion.' The report states that the emails illustrate racial, ethnic, or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the DOJ's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week. In fact, the report states, there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails, instead, the emails were forwarded along to others. *The list above is highlighted emails found in the DOJ's 102-page report on the Ferguson Police Department. The investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts. Officials say that at least one of the email recipients was among city leaders who met with DOJ officials to discuss the investigation, the Dispatch reports. The report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias, 'but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case.' The DOJ's civil rights investigation into the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 came after Wilson fatally shot the unarmed black teen on Aug. 9, an action that sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light. A grand jury did not indict Wilson for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown. Though the Justice Department found no grounds to prosecute Wilson, the case did spark suspicions into the department's practices. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the DOJ's report 'searing,' saying the investigation found the Ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be 'disproportionately harmful to African-American residents.' 'This investigation found a community that was deeply polarized,' Holder said. 'A community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents. 'A community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue.' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said Friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the DOJ, Reuters reports. The mayor said the city has been carrying a surplus of nearly $5 million to handle expenses related to the reform. Justice: The DOJ's civil rights investigation into the St. Louis suburb of 21,000 came after a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson (right) fatally shot an unarmed black teen, Michael Brown (left) on Aug. 9 . Protests: The grand jury's decision not to indict the Ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast Ferguson's mostly white police force in a negative light . Knowles said that while the DOJ did highlight many things in the report that must be addressed, there are also things that are an 'over reach.' Knowles did not comment on whether Police Chief Tom Jackson would step down, Reuters reports, amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders. The report highlighted the department's practices saying the city's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department's approach to law enforcement and the role of Ferguson's municipal court. The report states: 'The Ferguson Municpal Court handles most charges brought by the FPD, and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice, or protecting the rights of the accused, but of maximizing revenue.' The department also exhibited evidence of racial stereotyping, the report states. Several Ferguson officials told the DOJ that African-American residents exhibit a lack of 'personal responsibility' which causes the group to experience harm. However, the DOJ found that though some people lack personal responsibility, -- including officers within the police department -- the reason African-Americans in the city experience 'disproportionate' harm is the result of the department's many 'systematic deficiencies.' *The list above is highlighted evidence found in the DOJ's 102-page investigation into the Ferguson Police Department based on the department's findings and research . Ferguson Police Department: The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment . The report highlighted the fact that African-Americans make 'extraordinary' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor,  unfairly charged violations. Court records and emails show that while African-Americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets, city officials including the Municipal Judge, the court clerk, and department supervisors helped their friends, colleagues, and even themselves in eliminating tickets, fees, fines, and citations. The report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help. The clerk responded: 'Your ticket of $200 has magically disappeared! The report does not mention Twitty by name when referring to the 'Court Clerk.' But in capitalizing 'Court Clerk,' the report appears to refer to the head clerk -- who, the report noted, is white. The report found that some practices of the Ferguson Police Department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause.",

Officers at Tampa Police Department announced in a press conference on Wednesday night that the dog, since named Cabela, was bought from her owners for use in dog fights. Her owners had previously said that she had escaped or was stolen from their yard. She was bought by Natwan Callaway and Bobby Hollinger, both 17, who found that Cabela, a one-year-old pit bull mix, was 'too sweet tempered to fight' according to police. Detective Sgt. Patrick Messmer said a tip led to surveillance footage that showed an individual known to police who was then able to identify other people in the video. Callaway and Hollinger have been charged as adults. One of the two teenagers has a lengthy record to which can now be added charges of aggravated animal cruelty and trespassing. Horrific: Police inlcuding Sgt. Rich Mills (pictured) arrived at the scene to discover the Cabela had been shot three times and tied to the railway tracks . Cabela is now on the mend after her ordeal, and has been inundated with gifts and cards from well-wishers . The suspects turned themselves in voluntarily and have confessed. It is likely additional charges will be filed and other individuals will also be arrested. WTSP reported that in the video police saw a group of people walking the dog towards the railroad tracks in the Sulphur Springs area. Hollinger took Cabela into the woods and shot at her, but she ran away uninjured and was found at home. Callaway and Hollinger caught her and took her back to the railroad tracks, tied her down and Callaway shot her several times, police said. In the video, some people walk away, and then two people are seen running away. Officers received three 911 calls at around 5:23 p.m. on Wednesday March 4 from people reporting hearing gunshots. They heard a dog whimpering while canvassing the neighborhood, and followed the sound to nearby train tracks. Sgt. Rich Mills talks about finding Cabela and investigating the case of animal abuse at a press conference on Wednesday night . Survivor: The young pit bull mix, named Cabela, suffered injuries  so severe it was feared that her front-right leg (right) would have to be amputated. Vers were able to pin the leg instead . Officers discovered the blood-spattered pup had been shot twice in the neck and once in the shoulder and tied to the tracks. They freed Cabela and immediately took her to the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Center, where she is staying during her recovery. Her injuries were so severe that it was feared that the pup's front right leg would need to be amputated. However, veterinarians were able to save the leg. A post on the vet's Facebook page read: 'Cabela came through surgery with flying colors and four legs. The surgeon decided to pin it instead of amputation. It will be 6 to 8 weeks before we know whether she will regain full use and motion.' Cabela is doing very well, her bandage was removed on Tuesday and she is already bearing a small amount of weight on her leg. Her chances of making a full recovery are improving . On Wedneday evening following the police announcement that Cabela's attackers had been charged, Katy Meyer, owner of the veterinary practice posted her thanks to police and gave an update on Cabela's condition. 'Justice for Cabela, now that an arrest has been made!' 'We wish to thank the the Tampa Police Department for their thorough investigation into this horrible crime. We hope the individuals reponsible will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.' She added: 'Cabela is doing very well, her bandage was removed last night and she is already bearing a small amount of weight on her leg. Her chances of making a full recovery are improving.' Once Cabela fully recovers, she will be spayed, vaccinated and put up for adoption.

Billy Flynn was just 15 when his teacher and lover, 22-year-old Pamela Smart, encouraged him to kill her husband, Gregory Smart, in their New Hampshire home in May 1990. Flynn faces a parole hearing in Concord on Thursday, his 41st birthday. If he is paroled, he could be free as early as June 4. 'I think he did his time,' Gregory Smart's older brother, Rick Smart, told the Boston Herald. 'He was at a young age. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he shouldn't have been punished, but I want to put this behind me and I'm sure he wants to put it behind him.' Scroll down for video . Locked up: Billy Flynn (pictured in court in 2008) is serving life behind bars for shooting dead his teacher's husband/ He has a parole hearing on Thursday and the victim's brother said he thinks he should be freed . He added that although he would not use the word 'forgiveness' to describe his feelings towards the killer, he has realized that Flynn was influenced by Pamela Smart. 'I feel like he got his punishment,' he said. 'Maybe he can make something out of the rest of his life. What's important to me is Pam stays in jail for the rest of her life.' Pamela Smart remains in prison serving life without the possibility of parole. Their case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Smart was an instructor in a self-awareness program at Winnicunnet High School in Hampton when she seduced the 15-year-old Flynn, a fellow volunteer. She told him she needed her 24-year-old husband killed because she feared she would lose everything, including her dog and furniture, if she divorced him. Teacher:  Pamela Smart (seen in 1991) was convicted of conspiring with her teen lover, William 'Billy' Flynn, to kill her 24-year-old husband, Gregory Smart. Smart is serving a life without parole sentence . Murdered: Smart's husband, Gregory Smart (seen on their wedding day), was shot in the head in May 1990 . On May 1, 1990, he and 18-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart, a sales representative for an insurance company, to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn shot him in the head. To this day, Pamela Smart denies knowing about the plot. But the state's star witness, a teenage intern in whom Smart confided, secretly recorded her after the killing saying, 'If you tell the (expletive) truth, you'll send me to the slammer for the rest of my (expletive) life.' Smart, whose trial was the first to be televised nationally from start to finish, was convicted March 22, 1991, of being an accomplice to first-degree murder, conspiracy and witness tampering. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified in Smart's 1991 trial that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. He was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus credit for pretrial incarceration. Student: In this 1991 file photo,  Flynn testifies on his 17th birthday how he shot Gregory Smart in the head and killed him. Flynn pleaded guilty to killing Smart and  has a parole hearing scheduled for Thursday . Media circus: The trials's lurid details aired on television years before the O.J. Simpson spectacle . Flynn, who is serving out his sentence in Maine, will not be present at the parole board hearing on Thursday and will address the board on speakerphone. Gregory Smart's family members and friends have a right to make victim impact statements. State prosecutors will also weigh in. The three board members are expected to confer among themselves without leaving the hearing room at the state prison in Concord and then render a decision. If parole is granted, Flynn would not be freed before his parole eligibility date of June 4 and only after his final parole plan is approved by the board. Flynn's lawyer, Cathy Green, declined to say what Flynn would tell the board. But seven years ago, testifying on his motion for a reduced sentence, a tearful Flynn took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. 'I promise you I will carry this guilt and remorse with me every day for the rest of my life,' he said. Gregory Smart's father, William, told Flynn then that he might be prepared to see him go free when Flynn reached 40 but that he wasn't ready yet. William Smart has since died. On the big screen: The case inspired the 1995 movie 'To Die For.' In the film, Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Suzanne Stone, who becomes involved in a relationship with a teen, played by Joaquin Phoenix . Flynn married while behind bars, has a teen stepdaughter and has earned his GED and electrician's helper license. 'This never would have happened if it wasn't for Pam Smart,' said attorney Paul Maggiotto, who prosecuted Smart. 'It was Smart's manipulation of Flynn that caused this crime to occur.' Flynn's age and testimony against Smart were taken into account at sentencing. 'I desperately want you to know I'm not that weak person anymore,' Flynn said in 2008. Smart's friend and spokeswoman, Eleanor Pam, told The Associated Press that Smart is not taking a position on Flynn's parole bid but chafes at her life sentence without the chance at freedom. Smart told her: 'If they look at Flynn, they really should take a look at me.' Pam said that while Smart acknowledges the affair with Flynn led to the series of events leading up to her husband's death, she maintains she didn't plan it.",

Margie Shapiro and Sunni Welles both claim they were 17-years-old when, after a night out with Cosby, they woke up and realized they had been sexually assaulted. What's more, Welles was a lifelong family friend of the embattled comedian. Scroll down for videos . Sunni Welles (left) and Margie Shapiro (right) have come forward to claim they were raped by Bill Cosby when they were both 17-years-old . Over 30 women have come forward since last October claiming they were sexually assaulted by Cosby (above), who has repeatedly denied all their claims . The two women detailed their experiences in a press conference with lawyer Gloria Allred on Friday afternoon that was covered by The Wrap. Shapiro claims that she and Cosby met in 1975 when she worked at a doughnut shop in Santa Monica that the actor would frequent, and that he invited her to visit him on the set of the film he was working on at the time. From there he invited her to a dinner, but it was cancelled so he took her to the Playboy Mansion. Once there she says the two entered a 'game house' and began playing pinball. She said that she was not drinking at the time, but Cosby said whoever lost the game would have to take a pill, which she admits she agreed to. After losing and taking the pill, she claims she woke up to find that she was naked and Cosby was inside her. She says she passed back out but came to once more and that Cosby was touching her sexually. In the end, he told her she was not dressed well enough to meet Hugh Hefner and she was sent home with a driver. After that, she remembers 'feeling sick' when she saw Cosby's image in her head. Margie Shapiro (in photo at 17 being held up by lawyer Gloria Allred) claims that after meeting Cosby in 1975 at the doughnut shop she worked at, he invited her to visit him on set . Sunni Welles' (left) mother was friends with Cosby in the mid-1960s when she claims he invited her to go to a jazz club, pout something in her drink and then had sex with her . Welles meanwhile had known Cosby for years as her mother worked in Hollywood, first as a theatrical agent and then a story editor, and that as a teenager studying music she was thrilled when Cosby offered to take her to see some jazz back in the mid-1960s. Cosby and her mother had a friendship, so neither mother or daughter thought anything of it, and the experience of seeing live music would be good they thought as Welles was auditioning to be a background singer. Welles, like Shapiro, was not drinking, and ordered a Coke she claims at the club. After she had a sip she says 'things began to become blurry.' The next thing she remembers is waking up in an empty apartment feeling as if she had engaged in sexual intercourse. Cosby was nowhere to be found, so the young woman went home. Now Welles, who called Cosby a 'sexual predator,' is seeing if she might still be able to bring a suit against him. This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler (above with ex Andre Balazs) came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims . This all comes just days after Chelsea Handler came forward to reveal that she too believes she might have become one of Cosby's victims after he invited her to his hotel room in Atlantic City a few years back. Feeling uncertain, she decided to bring some male friends along with her, and she believes that is why she was not preyed upon by the actor. Over 30 women have come forward since last October claiming they were sexually assaulted by Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all their claims. In the aftermath however he has seen appearances cancelled as well as a Netflix special and a planned NBC series.",

        "input_text": "Today's long awaited report into Britain's surveilance powers was sparked by the Edward Snowden revelations . GCHQ was last night cleared of carrying out mass surveillance of the public using vast trawls of internet traffic. The Intelligence and Security Committee said the central claims made by the Guardian newspaper on the back of documents stolen by American whistle-blower Edward Snowden were wrong and it cleared the Government’s listening station of wrongdoing. After an 18-month inquiry, the committee dismissed the claims that GCHQ had ‘blanket coverage’ of web communications and was rooting indiscriminately through private messages. In reality, it said, GCHQ can access only a small part of the web and operatives see only a ‘tiny fraction’ of the messages collected after a sophisticated filtering process. The committee concluded that the only items seen by analysts were those of the ‘highest intelligence value’, and these amounted to several thousand a day. Tory MP Mark Field, a member of the committee, said: ‘The big mistake that Snowden and the Guardian made in its coverage was to equate bulk data with bulk surveillance. ‘The truth is that the filtering process means that a tiny proportion of the bulk data that is collected is ever examined. ‘That point was never really made by the Guardian, who gave the impression that with every phone call, every email and every text message, the public had a spy on their shoulder.’ Labour MP Hazel Blears said the ‘two main claims’ made off the back of the Snowden leaks were untrue and surveillance was neither blanket nor indiscriminate. ‘What we’ve found is that the way in which the agencies use the capabilities they have is authorised, lawful, necessary and proportionate. Labour MP Hazel Blears chaired the press conference on the Intelligence and Security Committee's long-awaited report into Britain's spy agencies . GCHQ Headquarters, based in Cheltenham, is the Government's main listening post and is allowed to monitor people's 'communications' to uncover terror threats . ‘But what we’ve also found is there is a degree of confusion and lack of transparency about the way in which this is authorised in our legal system. 'It is that lack of transparency that leads to people reaching the conclusion that there is blanket surveillance, indiscriminate surveillance.’ Another committee member, Tory MP Dr Julian Lewis, compared the process to using a magnet to pull a needle from a haystack. The agency does not have the ‘legal authority, the resources or the technical capability’ to intercept such vast amounts of material, the report concluded. The committee recommended a new law bringing together all the intelligence and security legislation. 'The allegation arising from the [Snowden] leaks is that GCHQ ‘hoover up’ and collect all internet communications. Some of those who gave evidence to this inquiry said ‘the agencies are monitoring the whole stream all the time’, referring to the ‘apparent ubiquity of surveillance’. 'We have explored whether this is the case. It is clear that both for legal reasons and due to resource constraints, it is not: GCHQ cannot conduct indiscriminate blanket interception of all communications. ‘It would be unlawful for them to do so, since it would not be necessary or proportionate, as required by [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act]. Moreover, GCHQ do not have the capacity to do so and can only cover a fraction of internet communications' Britain's spy agencies have to get a warrant to monitor an individual's emails, phone calls and other communications. The warrants are signed off by the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (left) or Home Secretary Theresa May (right) Shami Chakrabarti, director of rights campaign group Liberty, said the Parliamentary committee was 'clueless and ineffective' Councils were given more authorisations to access private communications data last year than GCHQ and MI6, it emerged last night. Town halls accessed records of telephone, text or internet use 2,110 times last year, the Interception of Communications Commissioner said. That compares to 1,291 approvals for GCHQ and 652 for MI6. MI5, which makes the vast bulk of such applications, was given 48,639 authorisations last year. Councils can use the powers to investigate fly tipping, benefit fraud, and trading standards ‘crimes’. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘The use by some town halls seems excessive – as if they were acting out their James Bond fantasies. I would encourage the press and public to investigate their actions further on why use is so high. ‘There is also a case for further tightening of these municipal snooping powers.’ Snowden, who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, released 1.7million files in one of the biggest security leaks in US history. He fled to Russia, where he was granted asylum. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, condemned the report, adding: ‘No doubt it would be simpler if we went along with the spies’ motto of “no scrutiny for us, no privacy for you” – but what an appalling deal for the British public.’ A Guardian spokesman said: ‘The Snowden revelations provoked a global debate about the role of intelligence and surveillance in the free world, and the extent to which it should be the subject of democratic and judicial oversight. Following the recent Investigatory Powers Tribunal ruling, it is now clear that the GCHQ and NSA mass surveillance programmes revealed by Snowden were illegal.’",
        "summary": "Agents at GCHQ monitor 'large numbers of items' to uncover terror threats .\nSpies use 'bulk interception' powers to track down terrorists such as ISIS .\nIntelligence and Security Committee said UK spies were not breaking law .\nGCHQ was not 'collecting or reading everyone's emails', committee said .\nBut it is 'unavoidable that some innocent communications' are snooped on .\nSpies at GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 have been  sacked for 'inappropriate' snooping .\nSpies have been sacked for misusing a vast computer system containing millions of pieces of personal data about British citizens. The committee found that MI5, GCHQ and MI6 had all disciplined – and in some cases sacked – operatives for unapproved access."

That's according to the former prime minister's granddaughter, Rachael Fraser, who delivered a loving tribute to her grandfather at a funeral service in Melbourne on Friday. Ms Fraser told mourners, including prime ministers past and present, that her much-loved granddad was a 'great leader' for the country but also a 'joker at heart' who put his kids and grandkids first. 'A few years ago, grandad was intrigued as to why all his grandchildren were taking photos and constantly checking their phones,' a composed Ms Fraser said. 'After a few long conversations about both Twitter and Facebook at, the age of 81 grandad seemed to have his accounts up and running in no time and became more active than all of us put together. 'I still remember the cheeky grin on his face when he said \"I've got 20,000 followers, how many do you have, Rach?\" 'This is only a few months after having his Twitter account.' Ms Fraser told mourners that he treasured his family deeply and had a way of embracing anything his children and grandchildren were passionate about, whether that be farming, horses, surfing or teaching.

'He also loved Christmas time, and at every Christmas dinner I always wanted to open the presents early and to convince the rest of the family grandad was by best bet. 'Once I had him on side it was harder for granny to say no. Grandad was always happy to talk no matter what time of day it was. 'At one point a few weeks ago, I called grandad at 10pm as I had to make a difficult decision. 'He was reading next to granny at the time, however, that didn't stop either of them from listening and picking up the phone.'

        "input_text": "Elvis Presley had one; so did Clark Gable. It was even the sedan of presidents. Then the name vanished amid an invasion of newer luxury cars from Europe and Asia. Now, the Lincoln Continental is back. Thirteen years after the last Continental rolled off the assembly line, Ford Motor Co. is resurrecting its storied nameplate. The new Continental debuts in concept form at this week's New York auto show. The production version of the full-size sedan goes on sale next year. Scroll down for video . Design: The emblem is illuminated along with the front headlamps on a Lincoln Continental concept car at the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center on Monday . New look: The concept car being unveiled Monday in New York is painted a deep Prussian blue, a homage to Continentals of the 1950s and 1960s . Features: The driver's seat has a patented split cushion, so if the driver holds one leg out further than another, it will support each leg separately. The moonroof glass turns opaque with the touch of a button . All in the details: The Lincoln logo is seen on a passenger's side front wheel for the concept vehicle (left), and the Continental name also appears on the driver's side door (right) Gleaming: The emblem for a Lincoln Continental shines on the grill of Ford's concept car at the New York International Auto Show . Switch-up: The Continental is expected to replace the seven-year-old MKS, which currently sits atop Lincoln's car lineup . Luxury item: Both Elvis Presley and Clark Gable once owned Lincoln Continentals . Overseas appeal: In China, customers know the Continental name and appreciate brands with a rich history . After more than a decade of toying with alphabetical names like LS and MKS to be more like its foreign rivals, Ford's 98-year-old Lincoln brand is embracing its heritage. It's a measure of the growing confidence at Lincoln, which is finally turning around a decades-long sales decline. And it's a nod to the importance of China, where customers know the Continental name and appreciate brands with a rich history. Ford CEO Mark Fields says the Continental always represented the best of Lincoln. Resurrecting it sets higher expectations, both within the company and outside of it. 'When we get a chance to work on an iconic nameplate like that, it's a mixture of pride and a mixture of fear, because when you put that name out there, it's got to deliver,' Fields told The Associated Press in a recent interview. Classic: This undated photo provided by the Ford Motor Co. shows two people looking at 1940 Lincoln-Zephyr Continental Cabriolet . Tradition: The 1941 Lincoln Continental is seen in this undated photograph .

Thrilled by the reception he got as he drove the elegant sedan around Palm Beach, Edsel made the Continental part of Lincoln's lineup. The Continental soon became the pinnacle of American luxury. Warner Brothers gave Elizabeth Taylor a 1956 Continental with a custom paint color to match her eyes. A darker historical note: John F. Kennedy was riding in the back of a 1961 Continental convertible when he was assassinated in Dallas. Continental sales peaked in 1990 at 62,732. But after that, Lincoln's sales began slipping.

A production version of the Lincoln Continental being debuted at the New York Auto Show this week will go on sale next year . History: Visitors to the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace get a look at the limousine that was built in 1967 for President Lyndon B. Johnson in August 1996. The modified Lincoln Continental was used by U.S. Presidents, including Nixon, until it was retired in 1978 . Ford had acquired other luxury brands such as Jaguar and Volvo. Lincoln's designs got dull and failed to stand out from lower-priced Fords. The Continental was also squeezed by competition from the midsize Lincoln LS, which debuted in 2000, and the bigger Town Car. Ford also underestimated the threat posed by German rivals, who were expanding their lineups, and newer Japanese luxury brands. By 2000, Lexus was the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S.; last year, BMW was. To make its way back, Lincoln isn't trying isn't trying to be sporty like BMW or showy like Cadillac. Instead, Fields says, it wants to give drivers an experience that is elegant and serene. 'We want folks to get into our vehicles and — for lack of a better term — chill,' Fields said. It appears to be working. Lincoln's U.S. sales rose 16 percent last year, making it one of the fastest-growing luxury brands in the market. The midsize MKZ was the brand's top seller. Full-size sedans like the Continental are a tough sell in the U.S., where buyers tend to prefer midsize sedans or SUVs. U.S. sales of Lincoln's current full-size sedan, the MKS, fell 24 percent last year. Disco era: The 1972 Lincoln Continental Mark IV is seen here. Continental sales peaked in 1990 at 62,732.

Cruising: A 2000 Lincoln Continental races down a road. The Continental was squeezed by competition from the midsize Lincoln LS, which debuted in 2000, and the bigger Town Car . But globally, the segment is growing, Fields says. Ford has high hopes for the Lincoln brand in China, where it's opening dazzling new dealerships complete with waterfalls. Ford began selling Lincolns in China late last year, and the company will open more than 20 dealerships there this year. The concept car being unveiled Monday in New York is painted a deep Prussian blue, an homage to Continentals of the 1950s and 1960s. But there are few other references to its history. Lincoln's split-wing grille, a feature that dates to the 1940s, has been replaced by a tight, rectangular mesh grille, its shiny chrome patterned with tiny versions of Lincoln's rectangular logo. The sides are smooth; even the door handles are hidden within a narrow strip of chrome at the beltline. The concept is a technology showcase. The driver's seat has a patented split cushion, so if the driver holds one leg out further than another, it will support each leg separately. The moonroof glass turns opaque with the touch of a button. Another button automatically moves the front passenger seat forward and fully reclines the rear passenger seat. That's another nod to China, where luxury car owners often have their own drivers. Under the hood is a 3-liter V6 EcoBoost engine that's unique to Lincoln. Ford isn't yet revealing more details, like whether the car is front- or rear-wheel drive. The Continental switched to a front-wheel-drive sedan in the 1980s, but many of its current competitors — the Infiniti Q70, Mercedes Benz S-Class and Lexus LS — are rear-wheel drive. The Continental is expected to replace the seven-year-old MKS, which currently sits atop Lincoln's car lineup.",

        "input_text": "A professional cleaner who mops up after extreme hoarders has told of the disgusting conditions he comes across almost on a daily basis. Josh Marsden, who runs Biohazard Trauma and Crime Scene Cleaning, has shared photographs from inside the houses he cleans up with Daily Mail Australia. The pictures document some of the worst houses in the nation, littered with piles of rubbish, mountains of food scraps and stacks of newspapers covered in faecal matter the company is forced to clean. Scroll down for video . Josh Marsden runs Biohazard Trauma & Crime Scene Cleaning and has shared photos from inside hoarders' houses . Here empty goon sacks and boxes are seen littered throughout the rooms of the house . In some photos, evidence of where someone has died in the middle of the filth is obvious. Mr Marsden assesses how dirty a house is on a scale of one to 10. Homes that fall into the rating one category are those lived in by basic hoarders who collect a lot of things, whereas a rating of 10 means there is so much filth in the house that you cannot see the floor, which is often also covered in animal faeces and infestations everywhere. For a three-bedroom, one-bathroom home, cleaning up can cost up to $20,000 if it scores a rating of 10. 'It usually would take three technicians two weeks to clean a home that’s rated a 10,' Mr Marsden told Daily Mail Australia. 'A 10 has animal faeces, bug infestations... [people are] just throwing rubbish everywhere, and food scraps get put in a pile. In extreme circumstances, employees wear Tyvek suits to protect themselves from hazardous dangerous of their jobs . 'I would rather live at the tip than live in some of these houses. At least the tip has fresh air.' One of the signs Mr Marsden sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step. He said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out-of-control homes. Mr Marsden said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week. He said cleaning up after hoarders was worse than mopping up unattended deaths, where people die of unnatural causes. This was the scene of an unattended death where a body was found lying in the middle of rubbish . Mr Marsden said most unattended deaths involved hoarders because most were ashamed to let people into their homes . Category 1: Organised hoarding but clean living . Category 2: Organised hoarding where regular cleaning should be undertaken more often . Category 3: The hoarding has gotten to a point where it is now taking over living space and rubbish is now a problem inside with ants nests, roaches . Category 4: In desperate need of sorting and cleaning out junk as valuable items are now mixed in with junk and rubbish . Category 5: Floor space half of what it should be with 50 per cent of the hoarding area now rubbish piles with some food scraps and mice infestation . Category 6: On the way to becoming completely out-of-control with dog/cat urine and faeces now mixed in with the rubbish . Category 7: All rubbish and food scraps, with valuable items un-noticible - only a pathway runs through the mess . Category 8: Same as 7 but now the pathway is also rubbish with no visible floor, several rooms used as rubbish bins . Category 9: Sleeping on dirty mattress or couch among the rubbish as rooms and kitchen are not accessible, food scraps thrown everywhere, roaches, bed bugs, all kinds of bugs. Rats/mice and mould with dry-retching smell. Place looks like a rubbish tip inside with two feet of rubbish in living rooms and higher in other rooms, non-working toilet and no running water . Category 10: Floor and building structure is compromised from rotting floor, walls, and too hazardous to be cleaned without a building inspection . But sadly most unattended deaths involved hoarders who were 'embarrassed or ashamed' to let people visit their homes. 'The bodies tend to be on the pile of rubbish. The rubbish is completely covered in goop and bodily fluid and faeces and everything that comes out a body. Cleaners are often met with two feet deep of rubbish along with caked on faecal matter on the floor . Inside the home of rated 8, which means rubbish and food scraps, with valuable items un-noticible and litter-covered footpath . Mr Marsden's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics . This is when a house reaches a level three on Mr Marsden's ratings system, with grime and dirt caked onto the kitchen bench . Another home with the stove covered in grease and the nearby sink is covered in stubborn filth . 'Floorboards often are rotten underneath because of the filth that grows underneath. 'Cats and dogs that live there p**s and crap everywhere. They usually live on the couch because there's nowhere else for them to go.' Mr Marsden's clients range from those who have mental health issues to drug addicts and alcoholics. Most people would think the filth would be the most difficult to deal with but he insists it's the hoarders who did not want to throw anything out. Mr Marsden said he would service houses with the rating of 10 every fortnight and three to four houses between a one and six every week . One of the signs Mr Marsden sees that indicate a hoarder is gumboots left on the back step . He said people who had extreme tendencies would use the footwear to wade through their out-of-control homes . This shower has an major mould and limescale problem that has remained uncleaned for a long period of time . 'We won't clean the property if the owner is present during the clean,' Mr Marsden said. 'We tell them to buy a box of stickers and go around and sticker everything with a red or green dot if they want to keep. Anything that's not stickered gets thrown out.' Despite the nature of the job, Mr Marsden said there was no shortage of candidates looking to break into the industry. 'We get calls every week from people wanting jobs. Everyone wants to be a crime scene cleaner because they see it on TV shows and think it's a cool job,' he said.",

The mother-of-three claims her daughter Demi Knox, was subjected to an online bullying and harassment campaign at the hands of teenagers from Middleton Technology School, Manchester. Joanne Higgs (pictured with her daughter Demi) was found guilty of assaulting two teenage girls . She said she was also forced to remove her daughter from the school after she was badly beaten up in the school grounds. Miss Higgs, from Middleton, said: 'I know what I did was wrong but I'm not a thug or a chav. 'I acted on how I was feeling at that time. 'I don't think I am the victim – it's my daughter who has been the victim in all this. 'She's had a nightmare.'

Dominique, now 16, said she had been trying to protect her friend from attack when she was punched . But Miss Higgs – who took to a local newspaper's Facebook page to defend her actions - said she acted on her own and that no other adults were involved. She told the Manchester Evening News she took action into her own hands after a gang of teenagers gathered outside her home and started throwing eggs at her house. She said: 'I had tried to call the police to tell them about it. 'These kids were taunting me in the street, they were hanging round my house. There were shouting abuse at me and my daughter. 'I had tried to resolve it with the school and some of the parents after the fight but had no joy. 'I just wanted them to stop harassing my daughter. She'd already suffered enough.

I called the police but they never came. 'I just wanted it all to stop once and for all.' Miss Higgs was given a suspended sentence of 15 weeks for each assault and ordered to pay compensation to the victims. She added: 'I want to put all this behind me. 'All I want is peace my daughter and my family. Demi has had no happy years at school.' Middleton Technology School said the school was 'dismayed and disgusted that our students were attacked in this way by an adult.'",

        "input_text": "This is the moment a five foot long unexploded Second World War bomb discovered under a building site in south London was blown up. A controlled explosion was carried out in a quarry at Cliffe in Kent this morning after the German device was discovered under a former pensioners home in Bermondsey in the Southwark borough on Monday. Soldiers of 11 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment) Royal Logistics Corps used two kilogrammes of high explosives  to blow up the Luftwaffe Sprengbombe-Cylindrisch bomb. Scroll down for video . Explosion: The unexploded German bomb found in Bermondsey, south London was blown up at a quarry in Kent at 9am this morning . Detonation: Staff Sergeant Ed Clinton (left) and Sergeant Rich McKinnon (right), of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regt Royal Army Corps placed the charges on the bomb and then walked back to a safe area 500 metres to fire the charge . The 1,000lb explosive was transported to the site in Kent, owned by Brett Aggregates, inside a skip packed with sand and loaded onto a lorry, which was flanked by police yesterday. The area in Bermondsey, Southwark, which was severely bombed during the Blitz in the Second World War, was put into lockdown from Monday night. It is believed the bomb was dropped over London by the Luftwaffe on 11 May 1941 but unusually did not detonate. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from their homes following the discovery by builders working on the construction site of the former Southwark Irish Pensioners centre. A police cordon sealed off 200 metres of land surrounding the bomb site for 32 hours as the Army built a bunker around the bomb to safely defuse it. The  teams, who had previously worked on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, used Hesco blast walls, like those used to build Camp Bastion and other military bases in Afghanistan during the conflict there. A soldier in charge of removing it has revealed that if the bomb had exploded it could have led to 'major loss of life' and significant damage to buildings. Senior Ammunition Technician John Lester said it was a 'a live munition in a dangerous condition' which had to be taken far from the city before it could be safely destroyed. SAT Lester, of 11 EOD, Royal Logistic Corps, said: 'This bomb was a live munition in a dangerous condition. It had been disturbed by some pretty heavy building machinery, which is never a good thing. Bombs don't like being bashed around. 'But once we'd uncovered it, we knew what we were dealing with and it was just a question of solving the puzzle quickly so we could get it away and the good residents of Bermondsey back in their homes. 'We knew we had to get it away to dispose of it safely because trying to deal onsite with a bomb that size, even under a controlled explosion, would cause significant damage to buildings, (and) property, and the risk of major loss of life in such a highly populated part of the city was very high.' Proud: The soldiers from 11 EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Regiment Royal Logistics Corps stand in the hole left behind after the explosive was blown up . The Ministry of Defence said it had had reports that this morning's explosion at Cliffe in Kent (the quarry before, left, and during, right) could be heard 10 miles away. These pictures show the devastating effects the bomb could have had if it was accidentally detonated in London . SSgt Clinton and Sgt McKinnon carry spades to the site of the quarry, where two kilogrammes of high explosives were used to blow it up . The authorities warned that 'remaining in your home is placing your life at significant risk' and residents were forced out of their homes on Monday night. Around 80 people were re-homed in hotels or empty council accommodation, while others had to sleep at houses of friends and family. Hot meals and tea and coffee were provided for nearly 70 people at the Seven Islands Leisure Centre and Canada Water Library during the day. Scotland Yard confirmed at around 6pm  that the area was deemed safe and residents could return to their homes. Residents were commended for their 'Blitz spirit' by local councillor Lucas Green, who referred to the residents as the 'evacuees of 2015', and said they had a mass phone charger swap', which was 'the modern day cup of sugar'. Cllr Peter John, Leader of Southwark Council has thanked the emergency services, St Johns Ambulance and the Red Cross for their support at the rest centres. He added: 'Thankfully we don't have to deal with unexploded bombs very often, but we do have plans in place to deal with such emergencies, and they work. Once again I want to thank residents for their patience and co-operation while the army and police carried out their work.'

        "input_text": "A treasure trove of rare silver coins and jewellery that date from the reign of Alexander the Great have been discovered by cave explorers in northern Israel. The 2,300 year old treasures were found hidden in a narrow niche among pieces of broken pottery within the stalactite filled cave. They were spotted by three members of the Israeli Caving Club who had squeezed through the narrow passages at the entrance of the cave to explore inside. Scroll down for video . Silver coins dating from the time of Alexander the Great were found along side bracelets, rings and stone weights (all shown in the picture above) in a cave in northern Israel by members of the Israeli Caving Club . One of the spelunkers, Hen Zakai, spotted something shining on the cave floor. It turned out to be two ancient silver coins. Alongside the coins, the cave divers found a cloth pouch containing a handful of coins, rings, bracelets and earrings all made from silver and bronze. There may be dozens of treasure troves waiting to be uncovered around the world, according to a recent map. From the missing Irish Crown Jewels taken in 1907 to lost Fabergé Eggs and looted 16th century Peruvian gold, designers have plotted their rumoured locations on an interactive map. In addition to the real riches, the map also features the location of mythical and fictional treasure in books and films. There are seven Fabergé Eggs thought to be missing including the Royal Danish egg, made in 1903, and the Alexander III Commemorative egg produced in 1909. Their estimated value is $210 million (£137 million). Another missing treasure is the Amber Room panels, which were originally installed in Charlottenburg Palace. It is rumoured to have been stolen by the Nazis and remains hidden in Konigsberg, Germany. Elsewhere, in 1901 the SS Islander sank after hitting an iceberg off the coast of Alaska. It is thought to have contained $250 million (£163 million) worth of gold. Among the mythical treasure on the map is a stash of $300 million (£196 million) buried by Benito ‘Bloody Sword’ Bonito on the Cocos Island in Australia. Archaeologists who visited the cave at the weekend say the coins were minted at the beginning of the Hellenistic Period during the reign of Alexander the Great. They believe they may have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the unrest that broke out following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC. It comes just a month after a chest filled with gold coins was discovered by divers off the coast of Caesarea, near Tel Aviv, Israel. Speaking about the latest discovery, a spokesman for the Israel Antiquities Authority said: 'The valuables might have been hidden in the cave by local residents who fled there during the period of governmental unrest stemming from the death of Alexander, a time when the Wars of the Diadochi broke out in Israel between Alexander’s heirs following his death. 'Presumably the cache was hidden in the hope of better days, but today we know that whoever buried the treasure never returned to collect it.' Mr Zakai had been exploring the cave, the exact location of which is being kept secret, with his father Reuven and their friend Lior Halony two weeks ago. The group had spent several hours exploring the narrow passages in the cave when Hen forced his way into a narrow niche and spotted the coins glinting in the light of his head torch. They reported the discovery to the Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery at the IAA. Officials and archaeologists then returned to the cave last weekend and found considerable evidence that the caves had been inhabited by humans. The coins were found in a cave in northern Israel alongside the agate gemstones and oil lamp pictured above . One of the coins found in the cave is pictured above and is thought to have been hidden by refugees during an ancient war following the death of Alexander the Great. The coin above features Zeus sitting with arm raised . Numerous pottery vessels were discovered in the cave and some had been there so long they had merged with the many stalactites that filled the cave. Archaeologists say some of the artifacts found in the cave date back to the Chalcolithic period more than 6,000 years ago. Some bronze items date back 5,000 years while there are others from the Biblical period 3,000 years ago and the Hellenistic period 2,300 years ago. On one side of  the coins is an image of Alexander the Great, while on the other side is an image of Zeus sitting on his throne, arm raised as if ready to wield his fearsome lightning bolts. Among the other items discovered were agate gemstones and an oil lamp. The Agate stones found in the cave, shown above alongside a Hellenstic oil lamp, were part of a bead necklace . Some of the coins discovered showed the image of Alexander the Great on one side (as shown above) while the other showed the image of Zeus sitting on his throne, which helped archaeologists date the treasure . The silver coins, rings and bracelets (shown above) are the first of their kind to be found from the period of Alexander the Great's rule over Israel, according to archaeologists who have examined the discovery . Archaeologists believe there may be more items to be found within the cave and intend to explore it further. Amir Ganor, director of the Unit for the Prevention of Antiquities Robbery commended the three members of the caving club for contacting the authorities about their discovery. In February the Israel Antiquities Authority announced that divers had found a chest filled with 2,000 gold coins dating back more than 1,000 years on the sea bed of the ancient harbour of Caesarea. Archaeologists say the coins, one of which is shown above, were crucial to dating the treasure discovered . The discovery comes just a month after divers found 2,000 gold coins (shown above) off the coast of Caesarea . The latest treasure trove was found in a cave in northern Israel while a previous discovery of 2,000 gold coins were found on the sea floor of the ancient harbour in Caesarea, just north of Tel Aviv and south of Haifa . He said: 'They understood the importance of the archaeological discovery and exhibited exemplary civic behavior by immediately bringing these impressive archaeological finds to the attention of the IAA. 'After the gold treasure from Caesarea, this is the second time in the past month that citizens have reported significant archaeological finds and we welcome this important trend. 'Thanks to these citizens’ awareness, researchers at the Israel Antiquities Authority will be able to expand the existing archaeological knowledge about the development of society and culture in the Land of Israel in antiquity.' A silver ring containing a crystal accumulation, shown above, was also among the items found in the cave .",

Yet with the 2012 discovery of his mutilated remains in a Leicester car park, Richard III’s reputation has been transformed. And starting today comes a remarkable national celebration for the last English king to fall in battle. From the embroidered linen bags containing his tiny hands and feet, to the simple tomb carved in Swaledale rock, the five days of ceremony are packed with thought-provoking detail. Scroll down for video . Family connection: Coffin-maker Michael Ibsen, who is a distant relative of Richard III, alongside a reconstruction of the King . His final journey will start at 1.05pm today close to Bosworth Field where he was killed in 1485 before ending at Leicester Cathedral, where our last Plantagenet king will lie in repose until his burial on Thursday. Richard will be attended by his closest living relatives and peers descended from the noblemen who fought at Bosworth. The Queen will be represented by the Countess of Wessex and the Duke of Gloucester. Richard of York, who lost his crown to Lancastrian Henry Tudor, has been vilified as a tyrant. But many historians now regard him as a typical king in turbulent times. His skeleton had a large hole in the skull, and crucially, a curved spine, which is consistent with reports that Richard had a hunched back. Bosworth peer: The Earl and Countess of Derby.

        "summary": "Five day celebration for the last English king to fall in battle begins today .\nFinal journey begins at Bosworth Field and ends at Leicester Cathedral .\nRichard will be buried on Thursday after he's attended by living relatives .\nDNA analysis confirmed remains found in car park in 2012 were Richard’s .\nRichard III’s coffin leaves Leicester University for Bosworth Field in a black Jaguar hearse, escorted by four police outriders and limousines, to start the preliminary leg of its journey. The oak coffin was made by Michael Ibsen, Richard’s nephew 17 times removed, whose family’s DNA was used to identify the King’s skeleton.\nThe bones have been packed in wool and Richard’s hands and feet have been placed in linen bags, embroidered with roses by children at Leicester’s Richard III Primary School. With the King is a wooden rosary, emblazoned with an enamelled White Rose. The skeleton is covered by a raw linen cloth, embroidered with York roses, by Elizabeth Noakes, of the Richard III Society.\nThe cortege officially departs Fen Lane farm. Close to Bosworth, this is where the battle was actually fought on August 22, 1485. Here Richard lost his crown and his life, when his army of 8,000 men was beaten by the Lancastrians, led by Henry Tudor. Archaeologists found more than 20 medieval cannon balls on the site.\nThe cortege will be joined by two knightly figures on horseback in 15th Century armour. They include Dr Tobias Capwell, curator of arms and armour at the Wallace Collection.\nRichard’s body arrives at St James’ Church at Dadlington for prayers. Here many of the dead of Bosworth are buried. Henry VII paid for a chancery in the church.\nFollowing the cortege is the 19th Earl of Derby, descendant of Lord Stanley, Richard’s Lord High Constable of England. He swung the battle by changing sides to support Henry, with his 3,000 men. Richard miscalculated Stanley’s loyalty – surprising since Stanley was married to Henry Tudor’s mother. ‘Stanley had by far the largest army on the field,’ said Lord Derby. ‘But he was in a very difficult position. The pillow talk was all about helping Henry. Richard took Stanley’s eldest son hostage and threatened to kill him. But Stanley said, “Sire, I have other sons.” Luckily, Richard never got the chance to behead him.’\nAfter the battle, Stanley retrieved Richard III’s crown from a hedge and crowned Henry VII on the battlefield. Henry rewarded him by making him Earl of Derby, calling him ‘right dearly beloved father’.\nLord Derby is one of the ten ‘Bosworth peers’, whose ancestors fought at the battle, who will follow the coffin later today.\nThe cortege stops at St James’ Church, Sutton Cheney, where Richard heard his last Mass before battle. While his army camped the night before the battle on Ambien Hill, above Fenland Field, the King is said to have spent his last night on earth at Sutton Cheney Manor, which no longer exists.\nAmong the VIPs will be Dominic Smee, of Channel 4’s documentary Richard III: The New Evidence. By an enormous coincidence, Smee also suffers from scoliosis, the curvature of the spine that led Shakespeare to call Richard ‘a poisonous, bunch-backed toad’.\nDominic learned to ride and fight in a specially made suit of armour  and proved Richard could have been the great warrior of repute and that his scoliosis was hardly apparent when clothed.\nRichard arrives at the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre where the coffin will be transferred to a wheeled bier. Covered with Richard’s Royal Standard, escorted by the two knightly riders, it will be drawn to the top of Ambien Hill for a Service of Commemoration.\nAs well as invited VIPs, more than 2,000 people have bought tickets for the event. Battlefield re-enactment society members will have held a dawn vigil in medieval dress. There will be exhibitions of medieval warfare, falconry, cooking and other aspects of medieval life. There will be a minute’s silence, then a 21-gun salute from eight medieval cannons. ‘It’s about reconciliation for the dead of both sides,’ said the Heritage Centre’s Richard Knox. ‘And to allow Richard to return from the battlefield with the dignity and honour that he was denied in 1485.’\nThe Battlefield Beacon will be lit – and it will burn until Richard is buried.\nThe coffin is transferred back to his hearse. The knightly outriders salute their King, as the motorised procession sets off for Leicester. The procession follows the route Richard took in 1485, through Market Bosworth, including crossing into Leicester over Bow Bridge – over which Richard led his troops to battle. Legend says his spur struck the bridge, and an old crone prophesied his head would hit the same stone.\nOn his return, Richard was slung naked over a horse, his hands tied together. Legend says that his broken skull did hit the same stone on the bridge. Trauma to his skeleton’s pelvic bone showed that someone stabbed him in the bottom.\nRichard’s procession arrives back in Leicester, over Bow Bridge, across which he led his troops 530 years ago. The coffin will be transported into the medieval St Nicholas Church, where prayers will be said.\nThe coffin will then be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by four black horses and driven by a driver in traditional dress.\nAccompanying them will be Jenny Gilbert, of undertakers Adkinsons. ‘We’re not having plumes or drapes,’ says Jenny. ‘It’s going to be simple. People said, “It’s not going to look like the Krays, is it?” ’Richard’s cortege will then make its way to Leicester Cathedral.\nThe remains of England’s last Plantagenet King will arrive at Leicester Cathedral. His cortege, flanked by the two knights in armour, will be escorted into the cathedral by the ‘Bosworth peers’.\nThe White Rose of York peers are the 18th of Norfolk, back from a family skiing holiday for the occasion; the 6th Baron Grey of Codnor; the Duke of Rutland; the 19th Viscount Hereford; and the Hon James Stourton, representing his brother, the 27th Baron Mowbray.\nThe Lancastrian Red Rose peers are the Earl of Derby; the 6th Baron Raglan; 29th Baron Herbert; 11th Earl De La Warr; and representatives of the 18th Earl of Devon and 8th Baroness Bray. ‘We’ve got Red Rose and White Rose, for Lancaster and York, because this service is about reconciliation,’ said the Dean, the Very Reverend David Monteith.\nThe coffin will be borne by members of the Armed Forces, including two senior NCOs from the 1st Regiment Prince of Wales, 1st Battalion Regiment of Fusiliers, and Royal Warrant officer first class from the Scots Guards.\nOriginally the Bosworth peers were going to carry the coffin – ‘but it’s lead-lined, so we thought it was too heavy,’ said a cathedral spokesman. The sermon will be given by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, as Richard was a Catholic.\nMore than 14,000 people from all over the world applied for the ticket ballot for the service. The 600-strong congregation is split between invited guests and the ballot winners. Those attending will include Wendy Daldig, Richard’s Australian niece 17 times removed. Her DNA, along with Michael Ibsen’s, was used to identify the King.\nRichard’s remains in his coffin will lie in repose in the cathedral from today until Thursday so that members of the public may pay their respects.\nOn Thursday at 11am, England’s last Plantagenet King will be reburied in a service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nThe Queen will be represented by the Countess of Wessex. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester will also be present, as will the ‘Bosworth peers’, the original ten now swollen by other Plantagenet courtier families, including the Duke of St Albans and Lord Scrope. Many others whose ancestors fought at Bosworth have been invited too after they were tracked down by Leicester University’s Professor Kevin Schurer. It is hoped that actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is Richard’s nephew 17 times removed and who will be playing the King in the BBC’s forthcoming series of The Hollow Crown, will be at the service.\nRichard will then be laid in a specially dug crypt in the centre of the cathedral, behind the altar. Overnight, his tomb, designed by the architects van Heinigen and Harward, will be constructed.\nThe tomb is made of slick modern Swaledale fossil stone block, deeply incised with a simple cross slashed into the stone. On top of a slab of black polished granite, carved with Richard’s boar badge, his coat of arms, is his motto ‘Loyaulte me lie’ – Loyalty binds me. White Roses of York have been set into the floor tiles around the tomb."

        "input_text": "Rail scam: Dr Peter Barnett (pictured outside court) faces jail after admitting to six counts of fraud by false representation . An international lawyer faces ruin after admitting dodging more than £23,000 in rail fares. Dr Peter Barnett, 43, was told he could be jailed after police discovered he spent more than two and a half years cheating the system. He gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an Oxfordshire market town to London’s Marylebone station. Investigators discovered the Oxford graduate and Rhodes scholar regularly pretended to have travelled from Wembley instead to save himself huge sums. The Australian-born lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children’s charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at ‘promoting prosperity’. On Friday, he pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates’ Court to six counts of fraud by false representation, carrying a maximum penalty of ten years in jail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain’s biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. He claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. Jonathan Burrows (pictured left) became the biggest fare dodger in history after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Right, how the Mail reported the story in August 2014 . When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found that the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. It is understood that he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket. He then got off at Marylebone, tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently £7.60. But this is still far less than the £19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. It was the same ruse employed by Burrows, who was caught out when his train company realised he had not bought a season ticket since 2008. Barnett’s train operator, Chiltern Railways, claims he now owes them more than £23,000, which he has agreed to pay back. On Friday, prosecutor Zahid Hussain told the court: ‘Clearly, the distance between Wembley and Marylebone, where he was working, is far less than to his true home of Oxfordshire, and as such he has gained financially. ‘The financial loss to Chiltern Railways because of his fraudulent conduct is in excess of £23,000.’ He said Barnett had also ‘altered a photo-card to avoid detection’, adding: ‘It was planned. It was premeditated.’ Barnett gave himself up after being caught by a ticket inspector travelling from his home in an Oxfordshire market town to London’s Marylebone station (pictured) Barnett is the author of a book on international law and worked for a major London law firm before becoming a senior figure at Gerson Lehrman Group, an investment fund consultancy. The New York-based company said he left three years ago. He blamed ‘family problems’ for his behaviour and his lawyer said he showed ‘genuine remorse’. Saul Herman, defending, said the loss to the railway company was ‘much closer on my calculation to £7,500’ and asked for the figure to be reviewed. But he said his client was in a position to pay back all the cash, saying ‘a means form has been completed which shows compensation can be paid in the full amount’. Barnett was released on unconditional bail while a further assessment of how much he owes is made. He will be sentenced next month.",

Jessica McCarty's five-month-old son Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children since Friday, the same day her other children, seven-year-old Laci and six-year-old Philip, were pronounced dead. The 33-year-old mother has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. Scroll down for video . Sole survivor: Police said Monday five-month-old Christopher Swist (right), died  three days after his mother Jessica McCarty killed his two older siblings in a botched murder-suicide. McCarty (pictured on the left in a suicide-protection vest with bandages on her slashed wrists) survived the attack and was arrested . What happened to the happy family? McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Laci McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself . Police say none of the three murdered children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were discovered . The attempted murder charge could be upgraded. Christopher's father came home and found him with a cord wrapped around his neck on Friday at the house in Palm Bay, Florida. McCarty's two other children with another father - Laci and Philip - were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Letter left behind: Investigators say McCarty left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do'. The motive for the attempted murder-suicide is still not clear . On Sunday, McCarty waived her right to appear at her first hearing, sending her attorney instead. In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appears in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape. Investigators have since revealed that McCarty left a note at the scene addressed 'to my family' in which she says she is 'sorry for what she had to do'. The note included a special address to her young baby's father, asking him to 'keep Christopher's name alive'. The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has still not been revealed. However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the Department of Children and Families for possible child neglect. The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. Christopher Swist, the father of the infant, also called police when he came home to find the children unconscious in a bedroom. Phillip McCarty (left) was the father of the two older children Jessica is believed to have killed on Friday night . Seven-year-old Laci (right) and six-year-old Philip (left) were pronounced dead shortly after they were found . Disturbing find: McCarty's partner Christopher Swist came home on Friday to find his son (pictured together above) and McCarty's two other children unconscious. The older McCarty children were pronounced dead on Friday. The infant was found with a cord wrapped around his neck and spent the weekend on life support . McCarty allegedly sent pictures of blood inside the home to Swist, leading him to come home and investigate. When he came home, he found his son with a cord wrapped around his neck and lying on a bed. Philip unresponsive in a corner and Laci unresponsive and wounded on a bed. A autopsy on the two McCarty children was scheduled for Sunday. Palm Bay police apprehended McCarty outside her home shortly after she called 911. Officers said they had to shoot her with beanbag rounds because she was 'uncooperative' and was armed with a butcher's knife. Jessica McCarty had her two older children with Phillip (left) before having a third with Chris Swist . Jailed: McCarty, pictured left with partner Chris Swist and her two eldest children Laci and Philip and right again with Chris Swist. She was treated for her injuries and then booked in jail where she is being held without bond . McCarty was in the front yard when apprehended, but she 'wasn't showing her hand' after several requests to do so. She then showed she was holding a knife and refused to put it down, police said. After refusing several requests to put down the knife, police said officers shot McCarty with five to six less-lethal 'beanbag' rounds, which are meant to subdue a person. McCarty was treated for her injuries and taken into custody, according to WFTV. The tragic incident has shaken the community and a prayer vigil for the three murdered children was scheduled for 8pm on Monday night. Following news of little Christopher's death, friends of his father started an outpouring of support on Facebook. According to his profile, Christopher Swist is a former Marine.",

Mr Netanyahu took to Twitter to declare a 'great victory' for his right-wing Likud party despite polls showing a dead heat with its main opponent, the centre-left Zionist Union. The Prime Minister wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for Likud, a great victory for the national camp led by Likud, a great victory for the people of Israel.' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured) delivered a speech for supporters after declaring victory in Israel's election - which exit polls suggest are virtually neck and neck . The incumbent Prime Minister (left and right) took to Twitter to declare a 'great victory' for his right-wing Likud party, despite polls showing a dead heat with its main opponent, the centre-left Zionist Union . Netanyahu (left) took a moment to greet his wife Sara (right) on stage after reacting to the early exit polls . He wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the people of Israel!' But his main challenger later disputed Netanyahu's victory claim, saying 'everything is open'. Speaking to supporters at party headquarters in Tel Aviv, Herzog said: 'This result allows us to return to power. We will wait for the real results - everything is open.' He added that he would make 'every effort; to cobble together the next coalition government. Polls carried out by the country's three major TV stations have shown an extremely tight race between the Prime Minister's ruling Likud Party and opposition leader Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union. Two polls showed the parties deadlocked with 27 seats each, while a third gave Likud a slight lead of 28-27. But all showed the centrist newcomer Moshe Kahlon with enough seats to determine who will be the next prime minister. Kahlon, a Likud breakaway, has not said which side he would favour - but is likely to drive a hard bargain. They also seemed to suggest that Netanyahu appears to have the slight upper hand in forming a majority coalition, thanks to his traditional right-wing and religious allies. Israeli supporters of the centre-left Zionist Union party wave their national flag as they take part in early celebrations outside the party's headquarters. Exit polls show the two main parties are neck and neck . According to the polls, carried out by Israel's leading television channels, Isaac Herzog's Zionist Union is tied with the ruling Likud party. Pictured: Zionist Union supporters chant for victory . But the Liked party were also celebrating after Channel 2 said  Netanyahu had eked out a narrow victory, winning 28 seats to 27 for Herzog. It also appears Netanyahu has the slight upper hand in forming a coalition . The Netanyahu supporters cheered as they heard the first television predictions for the election results . 'This is a great victory. It's almost a miracle,' Likud lawmaker Ofir Akunis told The Associated Press. 'For months, everybody attacked the Likud. And today is a beautiful day for the Likud. It sends a message that the people of Israel will decide for themselves.' The early figures set off huge celebrations at the Likud campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv. But the mixed results are sure to disappoint Herzog, who had been tipped to come out on top in the election. The results will be announced on Wednesday morning but the country will already be headings into weeks of negotiations, in a bid to form a coalition. The parties will all fall short of the required 61-seat majority in parliament. The early results, which will be confirmed on Wednesday, triggered huge celebrations at the Likud party's campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv . Likud supporters celebrate as Netanyahu declares a 'great victory' for the party and for Israel (left and right) Likud party supporters react joyously after hearing exit poll results in Tel Aviv this morning . Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his campaign headquarters . Israel is divided between two major groups of voters - right wingers and religious parties that tend to take a hard line toward the Palestinians, and parties focused on establishing a Palestinian state as part of a peace agreement. The left wing appeared to have slightly more seats, but would rely heavily on a new Arab list that has said it will not sit in a coalition. That gives Netanyahu, who his seeking his third consecutive term, and his traditional right-wing allies a slight head-start in the negotiations. Experts agreed that the vote had largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu. Final opinion polls published late last week put Herzog ahead with 25-26 seats with Netanyahu's Likud taking 20-22. But they also warned about the reliability of the polls, pointing to the 2013 election when they completely failed to predict the level of support for centrist newcomer Yesh Atid. Herzog (second left), pictured with his wife Michal after casting their votes, had been tipped to come out on top in the election . Moshe Kahlon, Kulanu party leader, greets his supporters  in Tel Aviv.

Whoever wins will fall short of the required 61-seat majority in parliament and will have to rely on allies to form a coalition . Supporters of Moshe Kahlon's party Kulanu celebrate after the exit polls were announced. The party has enough seats to decide who will be the next prime minister - but is likely to drive a hard bargain . This election season has amplified the bitter divide between hard-liners and moderates in Israel. In an extraordinary attempt to sway right-wing voters, Netanyahu announced on the eve of the election that there would be no Palestinian state if he were re-elected. As his party trailed the Zionist Union in final opinion polls, Netanyahu said that if his rivals were elected security would be compromised and they would give up total Israeli control over Jerusalem. 'We will continue to build to fortify Jerusalem so its division will not be possible and it will remain united forever,' he said on a tour of Har Homa, a settlement neighbourhood of annexed east Jerusalem. The outgoing Israeli parliament and the latest opinion poll . Netanyahu also vowed he would never allow the Palestinians to establish a capital in the city's eastern sector and pledged to build 'thousands' of settler homes. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as capital of their future state, and continued settlement building has incensed the international community, which sees it as an obstacle to peace. Throughout his campaign, Netanyahu has repeatedly accused Zionist Union leaders Isaac Herzog and former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni of being ready to abandon Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its indivisible capital. But Netanyahu's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was reelected. He later told public radio the two-state solution was now irrelevant, saying the 'reality has changed' and 'any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists'. Herzog, however, dismissed Netanyahu's jibes, pledging on Sunday  to 'safeguard' Jerusalem 'in actions, not just words, more than any other leader'. On Monday, he insisted Jerusalem would remain forever Israel's 'undivided capital'. The leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier -- as in 2009 when the centrist Kadima party then headed by Livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought Netanyahu to power for a second term. Under Israel's complex electoral system, the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes, but to the MP or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61.",

        "input_text": "Connecticut's Democratic governor says he will ban state-funded travel to Indiana over a controversial religious freedom law. 'I found it disturbing, disgraceful and outright discriminatory,' the state's chief executive, Dannel Malloy, said during a news conference on an unrelated issue. 'It hearkens back to a time when states were allowed to pass laws that treated their citizens differently. It's our shared past where discrimination was codified into our laws.' Connecticut will become the first state to bar travel to Indiana since its governor signed the religious freedom law last Thursday. Seattle, Washington, and San Francisco, California, have sent out similar orders, however. The bill, signed into law by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has the effect of giving individuals legal cover to refuse a customer's business if it would violate a religious belief to fulfill the request. Civil rights groups are characterizing the law as discriminatory, particularly against LGBT persons, and Republican lawmakers in the state today said they'd be open to clarifying the bill's intent through legislative changes. Demonstrators gather at the Indiana State Capitol on Saturday to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Governor Mike Pence. More than 2,000 people attended the Indianapolis rally. Critics say it would promote discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation . DUELING GOVERNORS: Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, left, a Democrat, said today that he would bar state-funded travel to Indiana in light of the new law, signed by into existence last Thursday by that state's chief executive, Mike Pence, a Republican . The details of Connecticut's retaliatory measure are not yet known. Malloy said Monday morning on Twitter that because of the law, 'later today I will sign an executive order regarding state-funded travel.' 'When new laws turn back the clock on progress, we can’t sit idly by. We are sending a message that discrimination won’t be tolerated,' he said in a follow up tweet. At a press conference later that day, Malloy said his state 'led the way to end discrimination and we should continue to be a leader in speaking out against discrimination across the entirety of the nation.' 'No state should use religious grounds to be the basis for discrimination in our country,' Malloy said, according to NBC Connecticut. 'Let me point out that it is a sad fact that in our history religion was used as a basis to support treating black and white individuals differently as well, and I won't allow any of our citizens in Connecticut to face discrimination in other states, at least without a fight.' More than 2,000 demonstrators showed up outside the Indiana State Capitol on Saturday to protest the new measure passed by the Republican-controlled General Assembly that Indiana says is meant to give its residents a platform to bring religious freedom suits against the government. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act states that 'a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability' unless the government has a 'compelling' interest to do so and interference is the 'least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.' The Indiana law now under a microscope says that 'a governmental entity may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion.' The only exception to that rule is if the government can show it has a 'compelling' interest to interfere and it did so through 'the least restrictive means.' A party that prevails over the government in court can now ask for 'compensatory damages' and may be awarded 'all or part of the costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.' Civil rights activists argue that the law is overly broad because it can be interpreted to apply not only to individuals acting in their personal capacity, but also to businesses. Furthermore, it goes beyond protecting Indiana residents' interests from intrusion by the state - it gives them legal cover from threats to their religious freedom from private entities, as well. Critics of the legislation claim it legally allows businesses to refuse the business of gay couples. A commonly cited example is that of a bakery that declines to take on the order for a wedding cake of a same-sex couple, citing religious grounds. Gay rights activists say such discriminatory behavior would not be allowed under Indiana law as a result of the religious freedom bill. A similar bill could soon become law in Arkansas. That state's bill, having already received the go ahead from the House, passed the Senate on Friday and now heads to recently elected Governor Asa Hutchinson's desk. Arkansas's legislation stats that 'governments should not substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification.' Hutchinson, a Republican, has already signaled his support for the law. WalMart, which is based out of Arkansas, and Apple CEO Tim Cook sided against the GOP-backed measure over the weekend. 'We feel this legislation is counter to this core basic belief of respect for the individual and sends the wrong message about Arkansas, as well as the diverse environment which exists in the state,' a spokesman for Walmart said in a statement provided to Reuters. Cook publicly criticized both state's laws on Twitter, saying, 'Apple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana's new law and calling on Arkansas Gov. to veto the similar HB1228.' Another business, Angie's List, said it would put on hold indefinitely construction on the expansion of its Indianapolis headquarters, a $40 million project, until the further notice. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's chief executive, Bill Oesterle, said in a statement. If Angie's List, an online database of customer reviews, relocates, Indianapolis' economy will lose out on a promised 1,000 new jobs throughout the next five years. The NCAA, also headquartered in Indianapolis, immediately condemned the law on Thursday, saying it was 'especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.' The final two rounds of the organization's hotly-anticipated annual basketball competition will be held in the city this weekend. The law will not go into effect until July, though. Democratic Indiana State Representative Ed Delaney speaks to demonstrators protesting the newly signed Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Republican lawmakers in the state today said they'd be open to clarifying the bill's intent through legislative changes to make clear its not meant to be discriminatory . The swift backlash against the law had leaders of Indiana's legislature reeling on Monday. At a news conference Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma and state Senate President Pro Tem David Long said they would be willing to change the wording of the law to make more clear that the state does not endorse discrimination. 'To the extent that we need to clarify that, by adding something to the law to make that clear that's not the intent, we are more than willing to do it, and we plan to do that,' Long told reporters, per a report from Reuters. 'Religious freedom and the right to be free from discrimination can coexist together,' he said. Pence expressed shock during an interview with the Indianapolis Star on Saturday at the national outrage that that's followed the signing of the law. 'I just can't account for the hostility that's been directed at our state,' he told the publication. 'I've been taken aback by the mischaracterizations from outside the state of Indiana about what is in this bill.' By Sunday the rumored presidential candidate had gone into full damage control mode, appearing on ABC News' Sunday morning news program this week. But he stood his ground and would not call the law a mistake during the interview, though, and declined to say whether it could be used to legally discriminate on the basis of orientation, as gay rights activists are charging, as homosexuals are not currently a protected class under Indiana law. 'This is not about discrimination, this is about empowering people to confront government overreach,' he told host George Stephanopoulos. 'Look, the issue here is still is tolerance a two-way street or not,' he said when pressed. A window sign on a downtown Indianapolis florist taken last Wednesday shows it's objection to the Religious Freedom bill passed by the Indiana legislature . Pence argued that his state is being treated unfairly by the same people who claim to be defenders of equal treatment under the law. 'From people who preach tolerance every day, we’ve been under an avalanche of intolerance,' he said. 'I’m not going to take it lying down. Furthermore, Pence said Indiana's law is similar to federal legislation Bill Clinton signed as president in 1993 and a measure that Barack Obama voted for while serving in the Illinois state Senate. Indiana's law has 'the very same language' as the Illinois bill the Democratic president voted for, Pence contended. Obama's spokesman rejected Pence's comparison in an interview on the same network minutes later. 'If you have to go back two decades to try to justify something you are doing today, it may raise some questions about the wisdom of what you’re doing,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in response. 'It should be easy for leaders in this country to stand up and say that it is wrong to discriminate against people just because of who they love.' President Obama notoriously 'evolved' on the subject of gay marriage during his first term and now supports it after having previously been against it.",

WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, called the station from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization. The station aired part of the interview on Friday night, hours after Cornell's attorney argued unsuccessfully in court that it could violate the defendant's right to a fair trial. Cornell said in the interview that both he and ISIS members worked together on the terror plot, which involved planting pipe bombs and going on a public shooting rampage. Reporter Tricia Macke asked Cornell in the interview 'Was it their idea for you to plant pipe bombs at the Capitol and have people running outside to shoot them?' 'It was mix of both of our ideas,' Cornell answered. Scroll down for video . Christopher Lee Cornell allegedly plotted to attack the U.S. Capitol in Washington and kill government officials inside it and spoke of his desire to support the Islamic State militant group . Cornell, asked by Macke what he would have done had he not been arrested in January, said he would have taken one of his guns, 'I would have put it to Obama's head, I would have pulled the trigger, then I would unleash more bullets on the Senate and House of Representative members, and I would have attacked the Israeli embassy and various other buildings.' Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of 'the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State.' He said: 'They might say I'm a terrorist, but you know we see American troops as terrorists as well, coming to our land, stealing our resources and killing our people, raping our women.' Cornell, also known as Raheel Mahrus Ubaydah, grew up in the Cincinnati suburbs and still lived with his parents. He said support of the Islamic State group is widespread. 'We're here in Ohio. We're in every state,' he said. 'We're more organized than you think.' WXIX-TV in Cincinnati said Christopher Lee Cornell, 20, called the station from the Kentucky jail where he's being held, confessed to being a supporter of the Islamic State group and said he planned to kill government officials in retaliation for U.S. strikes on the militant organization . He said that if he hadn't been caught, he would have attacked, President Barack Obama, the Senate, the House of Representatives and many other places in the nation's capital . Cornell, who repeatedly identified himself as Muslim, said he wanted to carry out the attack because of 'the continued American aggression against our people and the fact that America, specifically President Obama, wants to wage war against Islamic State' At times what seemed like a nervous chuckle punctuated his responses. He said he would do whatever the Islamic State group asked of him, including beheading Americans, and predicted 'there will be many, many attacks'. A federal indictment charges Cornell with two counts that carry possible sentences of up to 20 years each upon conviction: attempted murder of government employees and officials and solicitation to commit a crime of violence. He also faces a firearms-related charge. He has pleaded not guilty and awaits trial in Cincinnati. Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on January 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition. The FBI said in court documents that Cornell planned to 'wage jihad' by attacking the Capitol with pipe bombs and shooting government officials and employees. Cornell was coerced and misled by 'a snitch' trying to better his own legal situation, his father said. Cornell warned the news station that there were Islamic State group supporters in almost all of the United States . Cornell was arrested outside a gun shop near his home on January 14 after the FBI said he bought two M-15 assault weapons and 600 rounds of ammunition . He described his son as a 'mommy's boy' who spent hours playing video games in his bedroom. He also said his son was 'at peace' after becoming a practicing Muslim. 'He was dragged into this,' Cornell said before the hearing. 'He was coerced.' His son had long expressed distrust of government and the news media, and local police said he disrupted a 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013. The FBI said he had for months sent social media messages and posted video espousing support for Islamic State militants and for violent attacks by others. Cornell told an informant they should 'wage jihad,' authorities said in court papers. Similar stings in recent years have led to accusations of entrapment. But the FBI has argued such stings are vital for averting deadly terror attacks, and juries have returned tough sentences. Cornell (pictured left years ago) posted messages on Twitter sympathizing with Islamic terrorists led to an undercover FBI operation.

        "input_text": "Victoria Evans, now 28, was just two years old when she experienced her first beating at the hands of her adoptive mother, Eunice Spry. As many little girls do, she had pulled the labels off a collection of tinned food purchased by Spry and left in the kitchen of their Tewkesbury home. But instead of laughing off the mischievous toddler's prank, she 'went mad' and insisted that the little girl to eat the contents of one of the cans, regardless of what was inside. Scroll down for video . Brave: Victoria Evans was viciously abused for more than 19 years by her foster mother Eunice Spry . The contents turned out to be cat food and the toddler, retching and crying, threw up. Spry's response? Instead of a hug, she forced the child to eat the vomit as well. The incident heralded what would turn into more than 19 years of abuse at the hands of a woman described as 'Britain's most sadistic mother'. Victoria, and her siblings Christopher and Alloma, were subjected to a catalogue of appalling abuse at their foster mother's hands, while her own biological daughter Judith and adopted daughter Charlotte, were pampered and well-cared for. Now, all three children have spoken out for the first time and appear in the latest episode of Britain's Darkest Taboos which will be screened just months after Spry's release from prison. Spry, who was initially jailed for 14 years for her crimes in 2007, first had the tariff reduced to 12 years by the High Court and was released last summer after serving just half of her sentence. Depraved: Spry, pictured left after her arrest, meted out horrific abuse to her children. Victoria is pictured. Appalling: One of the cruel injuries inflicted on the children by twice-married Jehovah's Witness Spry . In a cruel twist, the evil foster mother was rehomed close to the scene of her crimes - and within a few miles of her victims own homes. ‘Why do criminals have more rights than their victims? She has served her punishment but mine will never leave me,' says Mrs Evans. ‘When she was sent to prison I felt safe for the first time in my life. I was so happy that she couldn’t hurt me any more. 'I never want to see her again and I do not want her living anywhere near me. I do not think I am asking for a lot.' Spry's crimes began shortly after she was given approval by social services to become a foster mother. The three children, all toddlers, duly arrived. At first, all seemed well but as the months went by, devout Jehovah's Witness Spry began to show a hitherto unnoticed dark side. Ruined: Christopher Spry, who was tied to a van and dragged around a field by Spry, calls her a 'psycho' Shocking: As a toddler, Victoria was made to eat catfood and then her own vomit when she threw it up . Beaten: Like her brother and sister, Alloma Gilbert was viciously beaten with 'a variety of sticks' by evil Spry . 'She thought I was demonised or that I was working in Satan's name and that we were the devil's offspring,' says Christopher Spry. 'We were always told that Satan looked after his own.' As the abuse escalated, Spry began to haunt the children even when they were at school, insisting that they tell no one what was happening to them and ordering them to present a happy appearance to teachers. 'She told me not to tell the teachers anything, and that she would know,' explains Alloma Gilbert. 'I was questioned several times by my teacher. I wouldn't tell her much and said I was happy.' But their troubles, which included being forced to stand against the wall for hours on end and eat branflakes soaked with linseed oil, were about to become much worse. Concerned that teachers were becoming suspicious, Spry decided to relocate to an isolated farm on the edge of the village of Eckington. Once there and with no one to see what was going on, the abuse worsened with the three children forced to sleep in the barn, while the others, Judith and Charlotte, slept in their own bedrooms in the house. 'Victoria and I lived in an old mobile home, and it had no electric, had no water,' recalls Mr Spry. 'We used to use a hose pipe to try and clean ourselves. 'Half the time, I'd be sleeping out in the field or in the chicken sheds and you'd wake up, and there'd be a rat on your chest. Road to recovery: All three children have written books detailing their abuse at Spry's hands . 'There was very little food, and I used to eat chicken pellets to try and survive.' The children, given next to nothing to eat by Spry, were always hungry but if they did happen to find food, they would find themselves viciously beaten. When some chocolates went missing, the three found themselves on the end of a particularly violent attack, which saw Spry batter them with a chair leg. On another occasion, they had sticks thrust down their throats leaving them in so much pain, they would be unable to swallow. But the worst beating of all was dealt out to Mr Spry who, as a 10-year-old boy, was tied by the feet to Spry's van and dragged at speed across a recently ploughed field. 'I blacked out multiple times,' he says. 'I was bleeding all over, I kept waking up and I was still being dragged. 'Then, she just took the rope off the van at the end, and I couldn't move.  We were in the middle of nowhere, there's no-one to help us, and my siblings came over and dragged me away. 'I can't remember the next few days. I was really lucky to survive. I probably should have died, and I'll tell you what, being dragged around that field, I wish I had. Brave: Alloma initially had to be persuaded to testify against Spry but says her life is better now . Sandpapered: Victoria, whose face was once sandpapered by Spry, escaped aged 18 . 'There is no way to describe how horrific that was. That is my worst memory of being with Eunice Spry.' For Mrs Evans, the worst incident came at the age of 14, when she and Spry's daughters Charlotte and Judith were involved in a fatal car accident. She was the only survivor of the accident, which saw their car crushed between two lorries, and was left first in a coma and then in intensive care for months. But even the hospital was no refuge for the terrified child, with Spry regularly turning up to threaten her with more abuse if she revealed what life on the farm was really like and railing against the twist of fate that had killed her biological daughter but 'left scum like you alive'. Shockingly, when Mrs Evans was offered the chance of physiotherapy, Spry turned it down and forced her to stay in a wheelchair for almost two years - even though she was able to walk. If she tried to get out, she would be beaten. 'If she saw me even try to get up and walk, she would take the feet pieces off my wheelchair and she would slam them into my shins,' says Mrs Evans. 'I wanted to walk, but I couldn't. I was frightened to. Once she pulled me out of the wheelchair by my hair, and then, she got some sandpaper, and she sandpapered my chest and my face.' But the years of abuse were drawing to a close and when Mrs Evans was offered a job as a babysitter, she saw a chance to escape. 'People were seeing me with black eyes, bruises all over my face, my face swollen up, cut,' she explains. 'I was seeing people my age, their mothers treating them with so much respect. I remember people asking, wanting to get their opinion. 'I found that quite eye-opening that these people were allowed an opinion. People my age were allowed choices and opinions.' Eventually, she revealed what had happened to friends and although feeling guilty about the possibility of her foster mother getting into trouble, agreed to tell the police. Her siblings Christopher and Alloma, although initially reluctant, agreed to testify against Spry and in April 2007, the evil foster mother was jailed for 14 years. So shocking was the scale of her crimes, Judge Simon Darwell-Smith told Spry that her 19-year reign of terror was one of the 'worst I've seen in 40 years'. He added: 'Frankly, it's difficult for anyone to understand how any human being could have even contemplated what you did, let alone with the regularity and premeditation you employed.' Tragically, while Spry, now 70, is back on the loose, her foster children are still trying to come to terms with her appalling crimes. 'I've heard her being called Britain's Most Sadistic Mother, and while that is true, that would seem to suggest she was a mother at all, and to me, she doesn't even deserve that,' says Mr Spry. 'A mother wouldn't beat down her own children. A mother could not lack the respect for human life in the way she did. 'She has destroyed everything that she could. She's ruined my life. She's a torturous, evil, twisted person, a psycho and we're very lucky hasn't killed someone.'",

Both mums joined host David Koch and commentator Shelly Horton on the program for a spirited debate about vaccination on Wednesday morning. The discussion came just weeks after baby Riley Hughes died in a Perth hospital after suffering complications from whooping cough. In views later labelled 'dangerous and irresponsible', Ms Whalan suggested parents should take anti-vaccination views into consideration. And in a fiery exchange with host David Koch, Ms Obermeder said that parents choose whether or not to vaccinate out of love for their children. Scroll down for video . David Koch, the father of four adult children and a grandfather, was vocal in his defence of vaccination . Fiery debate: Former swimmer Elka Whalan (centre) and Daily Edition host Sally Obermeder said parents should investigate both sides of the vaccination debate. Shelly Horton (left) said parents should 'definitely' vaccinate their children . Under fire: The Daily Edition host Sally Obermeder (pictured left) is the mother of toddler Annabelle, while former swimmer Elka Whalan (right) is pictured while pregnant in 2011 with her husband Thomas Whalan . Ms Whalan said: 'We are hearing this terrible story (about baby Riley) but we are also not hearing figures of people who have also died from being vaccinated as well.' The former Olympic swimmer said she vaccinated her children, adding that people need to 'research both sides of the story'. Ms Obermeder, the host of The Daily Edition and a mother of one, argued: 'Isn't it the parents' right to choose what they want for their child?' 'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child,' she told the panel. 'Parents love their kids, and they make the best decision... (they) think they're making.' Her remarks sparked a heated riposte from David Koch, a grandfather and the dad of four adult children. Koch said parents must depend on the word of experts, not 'Dr Google' (or information parents find online). 'There is no argument,' he said. Ms Obermeder said parents should speak to their doctors about vaccination and that people would then 'probably decide' to vaccinate. 'No parent chooses to do it or not do it because they don't love their child', Ms Obermeder told the panel . Koch (left) said: 'If you talk vaccinations in general, it isn't their decision if it effects somebody else's child... Not if it affects my grandkids'. Obermeder (right) said: 'Parents love their kids, and they make the best decision... think they're making' Poppa Koch: The Sunrise host poses alongside family members at a Disney On Ice premiere last year . Media personality Mia Freedman flayed Elka Whalan for her remarks on Twitter . Media identity Mia Freedman honed in on Ms Whalan's comments on social media, labelling them 'truly dangerous and irresponsible' in a series of Twitter posts. Ms Whalan fired back: '@MiaFreddman every parent & person well educated has the right to research. I am pro vaccine but you must see every side.' The parents of Riley Hughes urged parents to get their children vaccinated earlier this month. After their call, West Australian authorities approved a plan for mums-to-be to receive free whooping cough vaccinations. Around 2500 mums will be eligible to receive the jabs each month.

        "input_text": "It was the last resort of a hard-working single mother-of-four who, by her own admission, had 'never asked for anything from anyone'. On Tuesday Helen Campochiaro, 38, of Hudson, Florida, set up an account on Go Fund Me, appealing for support for her family after she was left injured and financially drained by a recent car crash and needed to find a new place to live within two weeks. However on Wednesday night, her 12-year-old son, Kevin Pimental, shot dead his six-year-old brother inside the mobile home he shared with his mother and three siblings, wounded his older brother in the leg, and then turned the gun on himself. Campchiaro was working one of her two jobs at the time. 'The mother's going through an absolute living hell right now,' Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said Thursday. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot his brother Brady Pimentel, 6, dead Wednesday night at their mobile home in Hudson, Florida, before shooting his older brother in the leg and then killing himself . Victims: Six-year-old Brady Pimentel (left) was killed in the shooting, while Trevor Pimentel, 16 (right), is recovering in hospital from a gunshot to the leg. He is too traumatized to speak with police . Heartbroken: Helen Campochiaro has been described as a hard-working, caring mother who was trying to provide for her four children. She was working at the time of the tragedy, police said . Scene: The shooting occurred the family's mobile home at the Sugar Lane park mobile home at 16916 Bachmann Ave in Hudson, Florida, north of Tampa . The victims were identified as  six-year-old Brady Pimentel, who was pronounced dead at the scene, and 16-year-old Trevor Pimentel, who is recovering in hospital from a gunshot to the leg. The three were home alone at the Sugar Lane Mobile Home Park north of Tampa while their mother was at work, Nocco said. Nocco previously said the argument was over food. Kevin and Trevor were believed to have been cooking together at the time of the incident, about 6pm. But a day later, Nocco wouldn't talk about it, saying only that the older boys were preparing food and deputies were still investigating. The sheriff refused to release many details about the crime, including the motive and where the boy got the gun, because he said deputies haven't told the mother yet. 'She doesn't yet know all the details,' Nocco said. 'She can't handle that right now. She emotionally and physically can't handle that right now.' Grief-stricken: Campochiaro shared this photo on her Facebook page following the horrific incident. It is an older picture of her two sons that died, Kevin (center) and Brady (right) Authorities said they have found no evidence that child welfare officials or police had ever been called to the home before the shooting. Campochiaro was a hard-working woman who had two jobs so she could take care of her boys, the sheriff said. On her Facebook page she says that she makes themed cakes and is a seamstress. Originally from New Jersey, she wrote that she 'will always be a Punk Jersey girl'. Campochiaro had been in a car wreck recently, but didn't even go to the hospital because she had to work, Nocco said. The boys' 18-year-old brother also lived at the home, but he was not there at the time of the shooting. 'It was a living night': Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco holds a press conference following the the shooting on Wednesday night, describing the scene to local media . Dedicated: Helen Campochiaro is a single mom with four son who worked two jobs to provide for her family. Her two youngest sons died on Wednesday night, and a third is in hospital . Helen's sister, Barbara Campochiaro, of Spring Hill, told The Tampa Bay Times the children 'were raised with gun safety' and that Helen owned a firearm, though she was not sure what kind. 'She was a single mom with four boys. Unfortunately, she could only afford to live in a trailer,' Campochiaro said. 'She just had it (a gun) for protection.' Kevin was in middle school. Brady attended elementary school and Trevor took virtual high school classes at home in the mornings and culinary classes at a technical school in the afternoons. Grief counselors were at the schools to talk to their friends, students and teachers. Trevor is in the hospital, and is expected to be OK. When deputies tried to talk to him, his heart rate spiked. 'You've got a 16-year-old who just saw something horrific, a living nightmare. I would never want anyone to be in his shoes. He's grieving right now. He just lost two brothers,' Nocco said. The family lived in the mobile home park off a dirt road in Hudson, which is about 30 miles north of Tampa on Florida's Gulf coast. Appeal: Helen Campichiaro set up this Go Fund Me page asking for financial help the day before the shooting. Since the tragedy, donations have skyrocketed to over $4,000 . On March 24, the day before the shooting, Campichiaro set up the Go Fund Me account asking for financial assistance from her friends and family. She was trying to raise a deposit for a new place. 'Me and my boys have had to start over from uncontrolled circumstances,too many times,' Campichiaro wrote on her account. 'Divorce,theft, abuse ... I have sold almost everything I own to make a better life for my boys,more than once.My four boys are my world and I revolve and live for them.I work 7 days a week self employed being able to work around them.' Campichiaro also alluded to having to leave her children at home while she worked. 'I regretfully feel like I never see my boys,' she wrote. 'They are so good and so understanding.They do more than their share at home and for me.Least I can do is put them in a good home.I believe in paying it forward and try to do my part everyday.' Friends of Campachiaro have set up a separate fundraiser for her on Give Forward, which has already received over $5,000 in donations. 'She is a devoted mom, an extremely hard worker, and an incredible business woman,' the page says of Campachiaro. 'Please help raise money for her family, for her son in the hospital recovering, and many, many expenses. Two of her sons were killed while she was at work, anything helps.'",

        "input_text": "A Phoenix woman who left her two young sons alone in a hot car during a job interview pleaded guilty Monday to a felony child abuse charge in a deal that lets her avoid jail time. The plea agreement calls for Shanesha Taylor to serve 10 years of probation, undergo parenting classes and pay an unspecified amount of restitution. Her children remain in her custody. Taylor attracted sympathy around the nation after her tear-stained mug shot went viral on the Internet. Her story of trying to get a job but not being able to find child care resonated with the public, and she received more than $114,000 in donations through an online site. Scroll down for video . National attention: Shanesha Taylor attracted sympathy around the nation after her tear-stained 2014 mug shot went viral on the Internet . Plea: Taylor (seen in the floral print shirt) pleaded guilty Monday to a felony child abuse charge in a deal that lets her avoid jail time . But she became the target of backlash after she missed deadlines to fund a trust for her children and questions arose about where the money went. In court Monday, Taylor provided one-word answers to a court commissioner's questions and, unlike her earlier court appearances, avoided TV cameras outside the courthouse by leaving through a side exit. Her lawyer tried unsuccessfully to bar a TV camera from recording the hearing. As part of the plea, defense attorney Valeria Llewellyn said her client, by leaving the children in the car, put them in a situation where they could have been hurt. Court Commissioner Jeffrey Rueter asked Taylor whether her attorney's statement was correct. 'Yes,' Taylor answered. Taylor was arrested nearly a year ago after leaving her two young boys in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a Scottsdale insurance company. Authorities said the temperature inside the car exceeded 100 degrees. A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely. Taylor told investigators she didn't have anyone to watch her then-2-year-old and 8-month-old sons. Deal: Monday's plea marks the second time Taylor has struck a deal with prosecutors to resolve her case. An agreement last summer allowed Taylor to avoid charges as long as she set up a $60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money . Broken arrangement: Taylor (seen here last year) broke the 2014 deal  by missing a deadline for putting money in the trusts, even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $40,000 . Monday's plea marks the second time Taylor has struck a deal with prosecutors to resolve her case.

But she broke that agreement by missing a deadline for putting money in the trusts, even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $40,000. Taylor has said she didn't fund the trusts because her children won't get the money if they decided not to attend college. Prosecutors had said the mother of three had spent about $4,100 per month, including more than $1,000 in non-essential items such as cable TV, clothing and dining. Taylor had countered that she doesn't live an extravagant lifestyle. The breach prompted prosecutors to then push the case against Taylor. The restitution requirement in Monday's deal doesn't apply to the contributions Taylor was given.",

        "input_text": "A California man who had been hiding in Hawaii for seven years pleaded guilty Thursday to killing his wife and dumping her body in a desert in 2007. Anthony Simoneau, 46, faces 11 years in prison when he is sentenced April 30 for the death of his wife, Fumiko Ogawa. After serving out his sentence, he will be placed on parole for another seven years. Scroll down for video . Justice done: Anthony Simoneau (left), 46, has pleaded guilty to a voluntary manslaughter charge in the 2007 death of his wife, Fumiko Ogawa (right) Punishment: Simoneau, pictured here in court Thursday, faces 11 years in prison when he is sentenced April 30 . Troubled marriage: Prosecutors said Simoneau filed for divorce in 2002 but then changed his mind after his wife inherited a substantial sum of money from relatives in Japan . Simoneau originally had faced a murder charge punishable by a 25-year sentence, but it was later downgraded to one count of voluntary manslaughter as part of a plea deal. Fumoko Ogawa, 41, was last seen alive January 4, 2007, near her home in Point Loma, California. After being unable to reach Ogawa for nearly a year, her family in Japan raised the alarm about her disappearance, but her husband never reported her missing, said NBC San Diego. Her body was found January 20, 2007, near the Bow Willow Campground in California’s Anza-Borrego desert, but she was not positively identified until June 2011. By that time, her husband had left the state. According to published reports, Anthony Simoneau filed for divorce in 2002 after six years of marriage, but had a change of heart upon learning that his wife inherited a substantial sum of money from her family in Japan. When Fumiko went missing, police said her husband went on a spending spree, buying four luxury SUVs, four boats, a motorcycle and three other vehicles, according to Honolulu Star-Advertiser. Mystery: Ogawa was last since in early January 2007. Her remains were discovered in weeks later buried in a shallow grave in the California desert. By the time they were identified, her husband (right) had fled . Nabbed: Last year, police tracked down Simoneau in Oahu, Hawaii, and had him extradited . Several months later, Simoneau picked up and moved to Hawaii, where he got a job as a tour guide on Oahu. Last September, detectives investigating Fumkio Ogawa's killing tracked down her husband and had him extradited back to California. According to Simoneau's plea agreement, the man killed his spouse because of a 'sudden quarrel in the heat of passion.' Initially, Fumkio Ogawa's remains uncovered in a shallow grave in the California desert were thought to be an unfortunate border crosser, but a DNA test determined that it was the missing woman. Prosecutors said the cause of death remains unknown to this day because of the body's deteriorated condition. Throughout the investigation, Simoneau repeatedly insisted that he had nothing to do with Ogawa’s killing. During a court appearance after his arrest in Hawaii, a defiant Simoneau told the judge that he was looking forward to having his day in court and proving his innocence, reported KHON2. Crime of passion: The plea agreement states that the 46-year-old husband killed his wife in a heat of passion during a fight . ‘I miss my wife very much and I will state, for the record, I did not kill my wife. I love her very much okay,’ said Simoneau to Hawaii News Now in 2011. But when a California judge asked him Thursday how he pleads to his wife’s killing, a dejected Simoneau replied: ‘Guilty, your honor.’ Chieko Ogawa, the victim’s mother, told a Japanese TV station that she was disappointed with the outcome of the case. ‘The sentence is so light,’ she lamented in an interview with NTV. ‘He got let off easy. We waited eight years and this is all we get. It’s unfair.’ However, the plea deal will speed up the process of releasing Fumiko Ogawa's body to her family in Japan for burial.",

When the 24-year-old construction worker went to a doctor the next day, he was sent home with some headache pills and told he was probably suffering from a bad migraine. But the pain didn't go away. For months, he put up with agonising headaches, dizziness and numbness. A New Zealander who had moved to Melbourne two years ago, Mr Ker was suffering and lonely, and turned to a dating site to find some companionship. 'I ended up meeting a beautiful woman named Rikki Milne,’ Mr Ker told Daily Mail Australia. ‘From the moment I met her, I somehow knew she was the one who could help my migraines disappear – by making all my problems seem like they didn't exist.’ But after three weeks of getting to know Milne, the left side of his body turned numb again. ‘I was struggling to talk,’ Ker said. Scroll down for video . The 24-year-old met his fiance Rikki Milne just three weeks before being diagnosed with a brain tumour . The 24-year-old had endured months of headaches but eight months later, doctors found a 'large tumour' ‘Fear struck me harder than it ever had. I was trying to explain to Rikki that it was all normal and it was just a side-effect of my migraines. But I could see the fear in her eyes too. ‘This time the numbness and paralysis didn't last just minutes. I rang my mum, who is a neuro nurse and all I remember her saying was \"call an ambulance\".’ When Mr Ker arrived at the hospital, he undertook a CT scan but alarm bells started ringing when he was told to do a second scan but with contrast dye injected into him. ‘That’s when I knew something was wrong,’ Mr Ker said. ‘Then the doctor walked in and all I remember her saying was: \"I am very sorry and there is no right way to explain this but you have a large tumour in the right side of your brain.\" Nathan Ker pictured getting his head shaved after undergoing a surgery to get the large tumour removed . Mr Ker said he didn’t know what was going to happen next, which prompted him to end his relationship with his girlfriend at the time. ‘I told Rikki I couldn't be with her anymore because I was not able to put someone through what I thought I was about to go through,’ he said. ‘But she said: “it would take a security guard to drag her out of there”. ‘I have no idea what kind of pain Rikki would have been in watching it all unfold - my family members were crying on my shoulder while I was sitting in a wheelchair - having to do all this without really even knowing me. ‘She ended up having to hold me up in the shower, dress me and do everything I couldn't do with only one side of my body working. This is now why I call her my other half.’ The New Zealand man pictured here with stitches after having his large tumour removed from his brain . Nathan's brother Jordan (left) pictured with Rikki Milne and mother Sharon Ker during the tough recovery . When Mr Ker went in for his MRI scan, he claims the doctor made a ‘mistake’ after leaving his CT scan on his hospital bed. ‘I read that the prognosis was a glioma and I instantly hoped onto Google to find  survival rates were a 30 per cent for more than a year, and 15 per cent for more than two years,’ he said. ‘I told Rikki that if I made it out of that hospital alive I was going to marry her as soon as I had enough money to put a rock on her finger. Ker received good news when he was told the tumour was non-cancerous . ‘Then right before the scan, she walked in and knelt down beside my bed with a lollipop ring in her hand from the cafeteria downstairs and said: \"I don't need a ring ... Nathan will you marry me?\" ‘I instantly said yes.’ After his MRI results returned, he received some good news - he was diagnosed on September 2 with a meningioma - a benign (non-cancerous) tumour, which is normally found in elderly people. ‘The doctor told me I was a very lucky man,’ Ker said. Following the results, Mr Ker went in for a surgery to have his tumour removed just a week later. ‘The neurosurgeon told me there was a 20 per cent chance I'd never move my left side again and an even higher chance I'd never get the same sort of movement in my left side,’ he said. ‘I remember having tubes and lines put throughout my arms and then waking up being wheeled to the recovery room. ‘I looked at my left side, too scared to move it, then I just open my mouth and start rapping a song I had written and tears started streaming down my face. ‘I looked down and moved the toes on my left side and then my hands. I started saying in absolute happiness, \"I can move my left side!\" over and over again.' Ker, who now lives in Melbourne, is a hip hop artist and hopes to get back into the industry when he's well again . After his surgery, Ker tried to go back to work but was soon forced to leave after suffering seizures . Recalling the time before the tumour was found, Mr Ker said the pain was nearly unbearable. 'My brother Jordan thought I was having a stroke,’ Ker told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I couldn’t move my body so he convinced me to see a doctor but when the CT scans came back – nothing showed up so I thought I was fine, until the migraines started. ‘I had already seen a neurologist and he had prescribed me heaps of different migraine medications to no effect, so I just toughed it out. The pain endured, weeks and turning into months of excruciating migraines during which he suffered physically and mentally. ‘This pain went on for eight months straight,’ he said. ‘Some days, I’d only get a few hours’ sleep and that lasted weeks. ‘I’d wake up in the middle of the night in agony and it would feel like I had a knife inside my head – and the pain and pressure I had on my right eye was unexplainable.' When Ker was released from hospital after his surgery, his fiance took time out of work to look after him. ‘I had found the most amazing woman in the world and couldn't understand why she loved me, but she did and over the next few weeks I slowly regained my strength,’ he said. ‘The recovery was hard and I had to learn how to walk again.’ The 24-year-old woke up one morning when he found half his body was numb where he struggled to move . After being released from hospital, Ker started working again but he soon suffered non-convulsive seizures, which forced him to quit. ‘One day at work, my head went blank and I couldn't even fold a box,’ he said. ‘I couldn't do simple tasks or see friends because I was ashamed of not being able to talk properly. I was back to having my family and fiancé pay for everything. ‘I felt like my brain had just stopped working and I couldn't talk properly but in recent times, my seizures have stopped. ‘But I have promised Rikki I’ll fly her back to our beautiful country New Zealand for a holiday. ‘I owe my thanks to my mum Sharon and brother Jordan, my fiancee and her mother and father Pnina Rosenberg and Troy Milne for accepting me as a son, and the rest of my family and friends for being there for me since day one.’ Family and friends have set up a Give me a Little appeal in a bid to raise funds for Nathan Ker, who has not been able to go back to work since the surgery.",

        "input_text": "A Silicon Valley venture capital firm has emerged victorious from a three-year high profile case accusing executives of gender discrimination. Reddit interim CEO Ellen Pao, 45, sued her former employer Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers for four counts of discrimination after she was fired. In a case that prompted a broad discussion about gender bias in the tech industry, Pao painted the firm as sexist, crude, and quarrelsome. On Friday, a jury of six men and six women rejected every claim after less than 72 hours of deliberation in San Francisco Superior Court. Scroll down for video . Lost: Ellen Pao (pictured after the verdict) sued her former employers for four counts of gender bias after she was fired. The Reddit CEO claimed her career crumbled at Kleiner after ending an affair with a partner . A jury of six men and six women rejected all of Pao's claims in San Francisco Superior Court on Friday . Over the course of three years, Pao told the court her career at the Silicon Valley firm crumbled after she ended a brief affair with partner Ajit Nazre, and was fired in 2012 when she complained. Pao, who is married to Wall Street financier Alphonse Fletcher Jr, said he 'falsely told her that his wife had left him' and 'engaged in offensive, obstructionist, and difficult behavior' until she 'succumbed' two or three times. After she ended the liaison, he started to 'retaliate', she claimed. At one point, she said, Nazre appeared at her colleague's hotel room on a business trip wearing nothing but a bathrobe, carrying a glass of wine, according to testimony. The court heard Ray Lane, a former partner, said the woman, Trae Vassallo, should have been 'flattered'. Kleiner countered that it investigated Nazre after Vassallo complained, after which he quickly left the firm. Pao's first claim, tabled in 2007, also accused senior partner Randy Komisar of giving her a Leonard Cohen book, Book Of Longing, filled with sexually explicit drawings and poems. Later, he asked her to dinner adding that 'his wife would be out of town'. The case played out as Silicon Valley saw a steady decline in the number of female venture capitalists. Recent figures collected by Babson College show six per cent of the venture capital is female, down from 10 per cent in 1999. With that backdrop, Pao's lawyers described Kleiner as a pressure cooker that was hostile toward women. One of Pao's mentors testified that subpar performance meant she was not promoted, rather than gender . The firm disputed those charges, presenting evidence that Kleiner went out of its way to hire women. During the case, the court heard one partner, Chi-Hua Chien, said women 'kill the buzz' as he argued only men should be invited to a dinner with Al Gore. John Doerr, once Pao's direct boss, told investigators she had 'a female chip on her shoulder'. And senior partner Ted Schlein rebuffed the feminist rallying call from Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg that women 'deserve a seat at the table'. He said: 'I really don’t think it was a very big deal to us who sits at a table or who does not.' Specifically, Pao alleged that: . The jury ruled against Pao on the first three claims but was sent back to deliberate the fourth due to an apparent miscount. Two hours later, they emerged in favor of Kleiner Perkins. The court requires a minimum of 9-3 votes to come to a conclusion. But initially, the verdict stated that four jurors supported Pao's view that she was fired because she sued for gender discrimination. On the pivotal claim that Pao was fired for being female, ten jurors ruled gender was not a substantial factor. They came to their conclusion after completing this question-and-answer document. According to Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Elder, Pao looked down and forced a smile as the judge revealed she had lost. Some witnesses, including Pao's onetime mentor John Doerr, testified that Pao's lack of advancement stemmed from subpar performance, not discrimination or retaliation. However, Pao's attorneys argued she played a pivotal role in the investment in RPX and Twitter. Pao testified for five days and faced questions from jurors such as whether it was 'professional to enter into an affair with a married partner?' 'Going back I would not have done it again, but I didn't think it was inappropriate at the time,' Pao said. Following the verdict on Friday, Pao released a statement via Twitter. In nine tweets, she wrote: 'Thank you, world. 'I have been inspired by the thousands of people who have reached out to me over the past three years with support. 'I’ve heard from people in Kazakhstan, Bangladesh, Australia, Malaysia, France, Argentina, Norway, Tanzania, Finland, and beyond. 'Because of social media and live reports, the problem of gender discrimination in venture capital has received attention around the globe . 'While today’s outcome is a disappointment, I take consolation in knowing that people really listened . 'If we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities, things will not change . 'Hopefully my case will inspire the venture capital industry to level the playing field for everyone, including women and minorities . 'To support the entrepreneurs of tomorrow, we need to show leadership today. 'And thank you to the team and board @reddit for standing by me.'",

        "input_text": "A seven months-pregnant woman whose baby was cut from her womb made a desperate 911 call after the brutal attack on Wednesday pleading for help as she was 'bleeding out'. The 26-year-old, identified at one point by the dispatcher as Michelle, spoke faintly on the six-minute call: 'She cut me in the stomach... I'm pregnant... I'm bleeding out.' The woman was able to give the dispatcher the address of the home in Longmont, Colorado where she had been attacked, adding that she was in the basement and had locked the door. She has multiple wounds, she said, and that the attacker broke a glass and stabbed her in the neck. The 911 dispatcher pressed her for the attacker's name and the woman responded that she didn't know the assailant and had gone to her home answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes. She added: 'I was trying to leave.' Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, allegedly stabbed the 26-year-old in the stomach and pulled out the baby, killing the fetus in the process, police said on Thursday. The mother survived the attack. Scroll down for the 911 call . Dynel Catrece Lane, 34, allegedly stabbed the 26-year-old in the stomach and pulled out the baby, killing the fetus in the process. She had lured the victim to her Colorado home using a Craigslist ad for baby clothes . Lane, 34, who is married and has two daughters, was driven to hospital by her husband following the horrific attack where she reportedly told staff she had a miscarriage . According to this online profile, Dynel Lane had registered for baby gifts and boy's clothing and noted her due date as November 14, 2014 . The dispatcher repeatedly reassured the victim that help was on the way and when her voice began to fade away, she urged her: 'You stay with me, don't go to sleep.' Police rushed to the scene and could hear the victim calling for help inside the home. An officer found the victim in the basement. Lane had left the house when police arrived. The victim was taken to Longmont United Hospital where she underwent surgery and is expected to recover. The baby did not survive the attack. Longmont police Cmdr Jeff Satur told Daily Mail Online that the female suspect was taken to hospital by her husband. Lane was reportedly carrying the victim's dead baby and telling hospital staff that she had suffered a miscarriage. The husband is not a suspect, the police chief said. ABC7 reported that the husband believed his wife had suffered a miscarriage. Police would not comment on whether the suspect had recently been pregnant. Comments on Lane's social media referred to a pregnancy last year. A relative said on Thursday that Lane had lost a child of her own more than a decade ago when he accidentally drowned. Lane's son was 19 months old in 2002, when he drowned in a shallow pond at the home of her parents near Pueblo, Colorado. Investigators at the time ruled the death an accident. Lane and her now ex-husband were devastated by the child's death, said Aaron Cruz, the boy's paternal grandfather. The couple had two daughters together and had been trying for a boy. A July 2002 obituary for Lane's son, Michael Alexander Cruz, in the Pueblo Chieftan said the boy loved playing with his sisters, cousins and friends and had just learn to sing his first song, Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Lane's then-husband wasn't home at the time of the drowning, the newspaper reported at the time. She and their two daughters, then five and three, searched for the boy until they found him in the fish pond. He had been playing a game with his sisters while their mother was busy in another part of the house, the newspaper said. Lane also lost her grandmother earlier this month, according to her social media posts. According to social media, Lane had remarried and was assistant manager at a franchise of a company, Once Upon A Child, which buys and sells 'gently-used' children's clothing. KDVR reported on Wednesday that a baby registry was set up in Lane's name last year and listed her due date as November 14, 2014. The clothing in the baby registry was for a boy. Public records revealed that Lane held a certified license as a nurse aide which expired in 2012. After speaking to the victim, police were able to arrest Lane at the hospital at 7.46pm on Wednesday. Lane was facing charges of first-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault, and child abuse knowingly and recklessly resulting in death, the Boulder District Attorney's Office confirmed on Thursday. Police are looking for any other mothers who may have responded to Lane's ad for baby clothes. A seven months' pregnant woman had her baby cut from her womb by another woman in a horrific attack which killed the fetus at this home in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday . Police said the 34-year-old woman who lives at the home stabbed the pregnant woman and 'removed' her baby. An armed officer outside the property in Longmont, Colorado on Wednesday afternoon . Police hoped to gain access to the home on Wednesday night using a search warrant. Investigators said they have an 'idea' of the motive of the attack but were not ready to release it until charges are filed . A man gives information to police near the scene of the horrific attack in Colorado on Wednesday afternoon . Under Colorado law, the charges are complicated by the fact if a child was not  born alive, then homicide charges could not be brought. The Boulder County DA's office does not expect to file charges until next week. Investigators have not released the name of the suspect or the pregnant woman but said they did not know each other. The 26-year-old mother-to-be had gone to the home alone to answer the Craigslist ad in Longmont, a town 30 miles outside Denver. A police officer removed what appears to be an evidence bag from the scene (left). Police planned to search the house on Wednesday night after bringing in a mobile crime scene unit (right) Police entered the suspect's home on Wednesday night after obtaining a search warrant. They hoped the search will better explain what motivated the suspect to engage in such a crazed attack. 'This is a tragic case for a mother right now,' Cmdr Satur told Fox 31 Denver. 'She came by this house. She was attacked, and her baby was removed from her.' The alleged assailant has two daughters, Commander Satur said. Her husband apparently drove her and the fetus to the hospital. Lane is scheduled to appear at the Boulder County Jail at 2pm on Thursday. It was not known whether the victim had any other children. The 26-year-old victim was taken to Longmont United Hospital where she underwent surgery and was expected to recover. Her baby did not survive the attack .",

        "input_text": "Jenny Ramage, 35, had nine organs removed in an operation dubbed the 'mother of all surgeries' after doctors discovered she was suffering a rare form of cancer . Over the course of a gruelling nine-hour operation, surgeons meticulously removed 10 organs from Jenny Ramage's cancer-ravaged body. One by one they worked to rid the then 32-year-old's abdomen of a rare and aggressive cancer invading her stomach cavity. Her right colon, spleen, gall bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes, appendix and umbilicus or belly button were removed in their entirety. Parts of her liver and diaphragm followed. The drastic operation, dubbed the 'mother of all surgeries', left Ms Ramage with a 14-inch scar running down the centre of her body - her 'survival trophy'. She repeatedly consulted doctors complaining of painful stomach cramps. And she was repeatedly dismissed, the finger pointed at period pains, bloating, appendicitis and irritable bowel syndrome. But the true diagnosis was a grave one - a rare and aggressive cancer was invading Ms Ramage's body. A doctor finally noticed a tumour on her appendix, which had burst, and covered her internal organs with jelly-like cancerous cells. Experts diagnosed the rare disease pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) - the same disease which claimed the life of Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn. She spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics, after making a full recovery. Ms Ramage, now 35, and from Bristol, said: 'The scar doesn't really bother me - I see it as a survival trophy. 'I have been very lucky, I have made a full recovery. 'There's nothing I can't do, nothing I can't eat or drink. 'But obviously my fertility was compromised, but I still hope to have children someday with the eggs that were frozen just in time.' Ms Ramage's ordeal began in the spring of 2011 when her periods became very irregular. In late summer of that year, she became very constipated and had a constant feeling like trapped wind on her right side, around her appendix. She later discovered this was the tumour on her appendix pressing against her insides. Surgeons removed her colon, spleen, gall bladder, ovaries, fallopian tubes, appendix and umbilicus or belly button as well as part of her liver, kidney and diaphragm . She spent three weeks in hospital but has stunned medics, after making a full recovery . She went to see a doctor several times but was given a range of different diagnosis - including trapped wind and bad digestion. 'I kept on being fobbed off and told it was IBS, they didn't really know what was wrong with me,' she said. 'One day I took myself to A&E, because I thought I might have appendicitis. 'They said it was probably just wind, and so I felt silly, as if I was a hypochondriac.' The cancer was finally discovered after a doctor noticed dozens of abnormal white spots covering her insides during a keyhole investigative test. She said: 'Then doctors thought my pains were caused by ovarian cysts, so I had scans which showed I did have cysts on my ovaries. 'But it turns out that's part and parcel of the disease. 'Then they inserted cameras into either side of my tummy to see what was in there. 'When I came around after the procedure, I saw little white spots on the pictures, all over my bladder, uterus and bowel. They were everywhere in my body. Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn died from the rare disease in Switzerland in January 1993 . 'But after that, I didn't hear anything, so I thought it had just been the ovarian cysts, which were removed. 'I was still feeling funny and not well, but I thought it must be nothing. 'I went to the follow up appointment months later and the doctor said it was nothing, but about 30 minutes later I got a frantic call from him. 'He said nurses had been chasing me down the corridor to catch me before I left. 'He had spotted the photographs and noticed the white spots, luckily he'd seen them. 'For noticing them, I owe him my life really. It all happened very quickly after that.' Ms Ramage went under the knife at Basingstoke Hospital, one of only two hospitals in the country that specialise in treating PMP. 'They discovered when they opened me up that the extent of my disease was much greater than the CT scan had suggested - the tumour was scattered everywhere, from my diaphragm, right down to my bladder,' she said. The 35-year-old now lives a normal life. But she faces the prospect of not being able to have children, after her fallopian tubes were removed . 'They removed all the visible tumour along with the worst-affected organs including my spleen, half my large bowel, my appendix, gall bladder, ovaries and fallopian tubes, the peritoneum, a bit of my liver and they stripped the surface of my diaphragm. 'They scraped some bits of disease off my bladder and uterus. 'They then pumped a heated chemotherapy solution into my abdominal cavity to kill of any remaining microscopic cancer cells.' The organs removed in their entirety are not essential to sustain life. Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a rare cancer, affecting around one in 500,000 people a year. It typically begins in the appendix, presenting as a small growth, known as a polyp. In more rare cases it is first detected in other parts of the bowel, the ovary or bladder. The polyp eventually spreads through the wall of the organ from where it has orginated. The disease spreads cancerous cells to the lining of the abdominal cavity - the peritoneum. The cancerous cells produce mucus, which collects in the abdomen as a jelly-like fluid called mucin. That fluid invades the abdominal cavity, causing tumours to spread. There are a number of possible origins of PMP, but the most common source is appendix cancer. There is no known underlying cause of PMP. Many patients lack clearly defined symptoms, making the disease difficult to spot until the later stages. The most common symptoms are: . Source: PMP Research Foundation . And from the critical and affected organs, the liver, kidney and diaphragm, doctors only removed what was absolutely necessary. Following the surgery, Ms Ramage underwent another radical procedure, a chemotherapy bath. This is where the stomach cavity is filled with hot chemotherapy liquid for around 90 minutes, while the patient remains under anaesthetic. Bathing the inside of the stomach with the heated chemotherapy increases the chances of the cancer cells being killed. Heat at 42°C kills cancer cells without affecting normal, healthy cells. The 35-year-old has made a full-recovery and now lives a normal life. But she faces the prospect of not being able to have children, after her fallopian tubes were removed. As a precaution she did have two sets of eggs frozen a few weeks before her life-changing surgery. Determined to help others afflicted by the rare disease, Ms Ramage has now turned her focus to raising awareness of the condition. She warned the bloating of the abdomen that is one of the symptoms caused as the tumour spreads can be mistaken for 'middle-aged spread'. 'The more people who know about PMP the more lives can be saved, the more people can be diagnosed and get treatment. It's all down to a lack of awareness,' she said. 'If I hadn't been diagnosed, it would have suffocated my organs and I would have died. It can be a slow growing cancer or it can kill quite quickly, it depends person to person.' Ms Ramage is releasing a music video which she has filmed with other PMP survivors and supporters of the condition. Her creation is a 21st-century version of Billy Joel's We Didn't Start the Fire. The video will be released on YouTube next week and her story can be followed on Twitter with the hashtag #PMPoneinamillion. For more information about PMP visit the charity Pseudomyxoma Survivor.",

Samantha Stuhlener gave birth to baby Levi at St Vincent's Private Hospital in the inner city Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy in January, but was handed another child to hold before nurses noticed the mix-up 45 minutes later. She and husband Chris revealed her story to Seven News on Tuesday night, but social media has since been flooded with comments accusing Mrs Stuhlener of overreacting. While some commenters have sided with the upset parents of the young boy - who have complained they have struggled to bond with their son who they say is often unsettled - others had harsh words for Mrs Stuhlener. Scroll down for video . Levi was born on January 6 this year to proud parents Samantha and Nick Stuhlener at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Fitzroy . His mother, Samantha Stuhlener, has had trouble bonding with her cherished baby after a mix up at the hospital which saw her mistakenly spend 45 minutes with someone else's child . 'Nurses are overworked and underpaid. It was an honest accident. Get over it,' wrote one woman. 'He was unsettled for 7 weeks after birth?! Oh my! That sounds... LIKE A NEWBORN', another posted. Others told the parents they should 'get some perspective' and mentioned those who were not so fortunate as to have a healthy child. 'While this shouldn't happen and is far from ideal, I don't think it is the end of the world. The babies weren't harmed and weren't left alone. Sad for the mum, yes. I would choose this over my son being still born any day,' one posted. Commenters have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the situation . Many posts have criticised the reaction of the parents . One woman wrote that while it was a bad thing that happened, other situations could be worse . 'Last week all we heard about was a young couple losing their 4 week old bub to whooping cough. THAT is traumatic. This is not. It happens more than you realise. Perhaps the reason the child was not settling is because the mother wasn't focussing on him, instead of focussing on what she didn't have - a measly 45 minutes. Get a little perspective', another wrote. 'I just think of all the poor mums who have to wait a week or more to hold their babies because they were born too early or are sick,' one more posted. However some commenters were more sympathetic towards the Stuhlener's, agreeing that the first moments with a child are precious, and they were robbed of sharing those with Levi. Some have asked the parents to be grateful for the fact they have a healthy happy child . Quite a few posts related to the fact that the Stuhlener family were lucky to have a well little boy . But others were much more sympathetic to the experience of the new parents . 'Some of the comments on here are heartless... this is a once in a lifetime precious moment. She can't get that back now. That first moment you get to bond with your child is magical, nothing comes close,' one viewer wrote. On Tuesday the Stuhlener family told their story, revealing that the proud parents were horrified to discover that they spent 45 minutes with another couple's baby, after a nurse mistakenly brought another child to them from the 'settling room'. 'I said what's happened, what's going on?' Ms Stuhlener told 7News. 'And she said, you didn't have Levi, you had somebody else's baby.' The two babies had been together in the overnight settling room at St Vincent's Private Hospital . The error happened despite both infants wearing the correct identification wristbands in the settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross-check the tags and mistakenly brought Mr and Mrs Stuhlener someone else's child. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff. 'It is extremely regrettable and our staff and myself feel gutted by the incident. We unreservedly apologise and take full responsibility for the incident,' he told 7News. He emphasised that throughout the stay the babies were only touched, fed and changed by their parents. 'While both babies had correct identification name tags attached at all times and both babies remained in their correctly named cots at all times, the staff member did not disturb the parents and check their name bands,' Mr Grisold said. Both children were wearing the correct ID wrist bands in the overnight settling room. It's understood that a nurse failed to cross check the wristbands and mistakenly brought the Stuhleners someone else's child . 'The second baby remained in the night nursery. 'When it was realised by staff that there was a baby in the incorrect room, the still sleeping baby was instantly removed from that room and returned to its parents. 'At no time was either baby picked up, held or fed by anyone other than their parents.' The hospital has told the distraught parents that Levi remained in the settling room during the 45 minutes period that they were with another infant. However, the Stuhleners are demanding the truth. 'I don't believe that,' Ms Stuhlener told 7News, unable to hold back tears. 'I don't know, was he (Levi) with another mother?' They have become suspicious as St Vincent's Hospital staff allegedly refuse to show the couple the incident report, which details where their baby was throughout the incident. The CEO of St Vincent's Private Hospital, Ian Grisold, confirmed the accidental baby swap and gave the parents affected both a private and public apology on behalf of the hospital and all staff . 'That's all we've wanted, to actually see what's written in the incident report and what actually happened,' said Mr Stuhlener. To make matters worse, the hospital's attempt to apologise resulted in another embarrassing mix-up. Mr and Mrs Stuhlener received a letter of apology and $500 worth of vouchers to try and make up for the error. However, the hospital sent them the wrong letter. They received a package addressed to the other couple involved in the mishap – the parents of the infant they mistakenly had in their care for 45 minutes. 'I acknowledge that we made an administration error in sending the wrong correspondence to the wrong family,' Mr Griswold confirmed. The Stuhleners claim to have been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised' The Stuhleners say they've been in contact with the parents of the other child and says they have 'also been left traumatised'. The couple insists the incident has had repercussions on their family. Ms Stuhlener says she has had more difficulty bonding with Levi than she did with her firstborn. Their son, now almost three months old, was 'unsettled' for the first several weeks of his life and did not take to breastfeeding. St Vincent's Private Hospital have changed their procedures to try ensure the error is not repeated. Two staff members are now required to cross check both the mother and baby's name tags when moving babies to and from the settling room.",

        "input_text": "Positive message: The Chancellor, pictured today in Tilbury, has portrayed Britain as ‘the comeback country’ with better times ahead . George Osborne yesterday used his final Budget before the election to help savers, low earners and homebuyers. Seizing on a run of excellent economic news, the Chancellor portrayed Britain as ‘the comeback country’ with better times ahead. He sought to blunt Labour’s lines of attack – notably on living standards – by declaring that families will be £900 better off this year than they were in 2010. By easing back his austerity plans to match the level of state spending under Tony Blair in 2000, he rubbished the Opposition’s apocalyptic warnings of a return to the 1930s. Tax cuts will be paid for in part by a £5billion double strike on the banks. Mr Osborne put thrift and home ownership at the heart of his nakedly political statement and said the ‘sun is starting to shine’. He delighted Tory MPs with a surprise announcement that 95 per cent of savers – many of them pensioners punished by years of low interest rates – are to be freed from paying tax on their life savings. A new personal savings allowance will mean they can earn up to £1,000 in interest without paying tax. With most accounts paying around 1 per cent, this would mean nest-eggs of up to £100,000 would be exempt. Other measures in Mr Osborne’s sixth Budget included: . Mr Osborne also sought to dispel perceptions that the Tories were friends of the rich by cutting pension tax relief for the best-off. With just 50 days to go to the election, he allowed himself a pat on the back for ‘historic’ jobs figures, published ahead of the Budget. There are now 30.9million people in work – an all-time high – with the coalition overseeing the creation of 1,600 jobs a day over the past year. Revealed: Mail analysis of the budget reveals how tax and National Insurance changes from April will affect your income from April . Debate: Sky News host Eamonn Holmes took the Chancellor to task in a series of post-Budget interviews given this morning . The public sector payroll is down to 5.4million, or 17 per cent of the workforce, a record low. But in a significant rebalancing of the economy, there are 2.3million more in private sector jobs than 2010. While Labour’s Ed Miliband had wanted the UK to follow the policy measures of socialist France, the British economy was now growing at seven times its rate, Mr Osborne said.Scroll down for video . And though Labour had claimed austerity measures would mean a million more unemployed, the ‘great county’ of Yorkshire had created more jobs than the whole of France on its own. ‘The sun is starting to shine – and we are fixing the roof,’ the Chancellor told MPs. ‘We took difficult decisions in the teeth of opposition and it worked. Britain is walking tall again. ‘Five years ago, our economy had suffered a collapse greater than almost any country. Today, I can confirm: in the last year we have grown faster than any other major advanced economy in the world. ‘The critical choice facing the country now is this: do we return to the chaos of the past? Or do we say to the British people, let’s work through the plan that is delivering for you? ‘We choose the future. Our goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous economy in the world.’ George Osborne, pictured holding up his Budget briefcase for the cameras outside 11 Downing Street, yesterday used his final Budget before the election to help savers, low earners and homebuyers . Labour leader Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne had ‘failed working families’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £1,600 a year worse off . Mr Osborne hailed better than expected growth figures, which suggest the economy will expand by 2.5 per cent this year. He also announced that the Government had met its target set in 2010 to see national debt falling as a share of national income by the time of the next election. The Chancellor said the beneficial effect on the public finances of lower inflation, plus a sell-off of a chunk of mortgage debts nationalised in the financial crisis, meant he could pay down some of Britain’s vast debt pile. He also said he would end the squeeze on public spending a year earlier than planned. By 2019, public spending would be growing again in line with the economy. Acknowledging the pain of years of austerity, the Chancellor said ‘the hard work and sacrifice of the British people has paid off’. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility said public spending faces a ‘rollercoaster’ ride, with tough cuts between 2016 and 2018 followed by a surge in spending at the end of the decade. Labour leader Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne had ‘failed working families’ and stuck to his claim that households are on average £1,600 a year worse off. ‘This is a Budget that people won’t believe from a government that is not on their side,’ Mr Miliband told MPs. ‘Five years ago, what did the Chancellor say – “we will balance the books in five years”. No ifs, no buts – just like the immigration pledge. The only thing long term about his plan is that it will take twice as long to balance the books. That is the reality.’ Though the Tories have vowed to maintain protection for the NHS budget, Mr Miliband claimed they must have a ‘secret plan’ to cut it because ‘colossal’ cuts to other areas of spending would not otherwise be deliverable. The Lib Dems, who will today set out alternative plans for the years after 2016, claimed credit for the hikes in the personal income tax allowance.",

Duman's account follows the similar naming conventions as previous social media accounts. It also  featured pictures of her late reported partner, the so-called 'Playboy Jihadi' Mahmoud Abdullatif, as her 'beautiful husband'.

        "input_text": "Determined not to let the Italian court's judgement over whether she was responsible for the murder of Meredith Kercher keep her in hiding, Amanda Knox strolls hand-in-hand with her fiancé. The 27-year-old was joined by musician Colin Sutherland and her mother, Edda Mellas, as they took a brief walk outside her family home in Seattle, Washington, on Thursday evening. Knox and Sutherland, 27,  clasped their hands together but both appeared nervous and sported serious expressions, with neither smiling, as they took advantage of the spring evening. Scroll down for video . Clutch: Amanda Knox and fiancé Colin Sutherland seen going for a stroll on Thursday evening. The Italian court is expected to decide whether or not Knox is guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher today . Tension is in the air as Amanda and Colin take a brief stroll before returning inside home of Amanda's mom . The couple see her mom off as she takes her dogs for a walk. Amanda's mom Edda Mellas walks her dogs. Knox’s family are rallying around her and trying to help her lead as normal a life as possible in the run up to the final decision by the Court of Cassation - Italy's highest court - in Rome on Friday. Shortly before their walk, Sutherland was seen carrying a bag of ice and two bags of shopping into the house, possibly supplies for a long and agonizing night waiting for the verdict. Earlier on Thursday, Amanda – who in 2013 penned memoir Waiting to be Heard about the murder case and her four years in jail - was spotted with her fiance writing on a notepad in the backyard. The Italian court is set to decide if it will uphold a 2013 ruling declaring Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the 2007 killing of the British exchange student. The decision was due on Wednesday but has been delayed. And today, Sollecito's lawyer launched a last-ditch attempt to save his own skin and blow a hole in American's defense. The former lover was compared to a 'Forrest Gump' caught up in events beyond his understanding. Knox and Sollecito had originally been convicted in 2009, but were acquitted in 2011, allowing Knox to fly back to her hometown in the US, although the verdict was then reversed in 2013. There are a number of possible outcomes to the trial: Either both Knox and Sollecito will be found guilty, they will both be declared not guilty, one will be convicted but not the other, or the whole thing could go back for another round of appeal. Even if the trial does end in a conviction, former judge Mike Heavey – who has long championed Knox’s cause and become close to her family, even being invited to her wedding - says he feels there is little chance of her being extradited to Italy for the 28 and a half year sentence she has been handed if convicted. Earlier in the day, sitting in the afternoon sun, Amanda Knox calmly wrote in her journal in mom's backyard . If declared guilty, the decision to extradite Amanda back to Italy ultimately rests in the hand of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry . Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online, he said: ‘I imagine it’s been very tense for [the Knox family]. I’m optimistic the case will be dismissed and they’ll be acquitted. ‘Well respected scientists are coming in and debunking the DNA evidence against them and public opinion [in Italy] has gone from 90% against to around 80% for her. ‘Raffaele was in court Wednesday which is good. They never really aimed at Raffaele, it’s always been Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. Very sexist, by the way, very anti-American. ‘But this has been a witch-hunt, as if it was Salem, Massachusetts, 1691. No different except that it goes global. ‘And it titillates a great percentage of people, they find is fascinating, this idea of a sex orgy gone wrong and two pretty girls that was originally put forward by the prosecution.’ Referring to the 2003 kidnapping and transportation to Egypt of Italian cleric Abu Omar by the CIA and the subsequent conviction in absentia by an Italian court of ex-CIA operative Robert Seldon Lady for that crime, he added: ‘There’s good reasons to dislike the Americans, we’ve done a lot of bad things around the world, I can agree with a lot of their criticisms. Ms Kercher, a 21-year-old student from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in Perugia in 2007. The house in Perugia where British student Meredith Kercher was murdered aged just 21 in November 2007 . Raffaele Sollecito is pictured leaving Rome's Supreme Court on Wednesday as Italy's top judges delayed  a ruling on whether to uphold his and Amanda Knox's conviction for the murder of student Meredith Kercher . Rudy Guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in Kercher's death after a separate trial . ‘Our CIA kidnapped an Islamic cleric, an Italian citizen, and they can’t get their minister of justice to ask the US for an extradition, they can’t get it done, so they’re frustrated. ‘[But in this case] Raffaele is collateral damage. If we confirm their convictions, we send an innocent Italian man – and the people probably won’t like that – to prison, and the [Italian] Minister of Justice probably won’t even ask for extradition, but even if he did are they going to pick a fight with the United states of America on a false claim? ‘The kidnapping of an Italian citizen – that’s a legitimate claim and they still don’t want to take on the USA. So are they going to take on the US on a B.S. claim? ‘No. It’s a fraud, and everybody knows it and everybody is playing along.' If Knox is declared guilty, the decision to extradite her back to Italy ultimately rests in the hand of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry.",

The dramatic scene ended after a pair of local teenagers also chased after the man and he set the boy down and ran off on Sunday, authorities said. The 22-month-old boy - called Owen - was unhurt, said Lincoln County Sheriff Wade Magers. Authorities are searching for a man caught on surveillance video running down a sidewalk with a toddler in his arms, in what authorities in the town of Sprague, Washington, say was a failed kidnapping on Sunday . Authorities are searching for a man caught on surveillance video running down a sidewalk with a toddler in his arms, in what authorities in the town of Sprague, Washington, say was a failed kidnapping on Sunday . Owen's older sister Delicia, left, and brother Brenden, right, were also captured on security video footage as they gave chase after the man who had taken their younger brother . Authorities said they don't believe the man is a resident of Sprague, a wheat farming town of about 500 people located 40 miles west of Spokane. 'We don't believe him to be a local at this point,' Magers said. 'We'd recognize him if he was local.' Magers said authorities have no leads in the case. Michael Wright, the boy's father, said he was horrified by the incident. 'I can't explain the feeling, the anxiety and everything that goes into finding out your children is missing or something has happened to them,' Wright told KXLY-TV of Spokane. Wright left his three children with a baby sitter Sunday while he went to work. The children, Brenden, 10; Delicia, 8; and the boy were playing unsupervised in a city park near the sitter's house, he told KXLY. Sheriff's deputies said a man talked with the children for a few minutes, then scooped the toddler out of his stroller and ran down the street. Surveillance video from a grocery store showed the kidnapper running, child in arms, with Delicia chasing and Brenden not far behind. Delicia's screams alerted Dorothy Giddings, who was working at her antique store downtown, reports KIRO7. 'I said there is something wrong,' Giddings recalled Tuesday. Father Michael Wright said he was horrified that his children were left unsupervised in a park by their babysitter . 'Then this man busts out and runs across the street and he's got a baby and a little girl right behind him screaming,' Giddings said. 'The girl said, 'That man got my baby brother! That man got my baby brother!'' Giddings said she realized what was happening and sent her teenage grandson and his friend to chase the man. As the older boys approached, the kidnapper put the child down in a vacant lot and fled, the sheriff's office said. No vehicle was seen with the suspect, who is described as about 30 years old, 6-foot to 6-foot-2, with a thin build, brown hair and a mustache. 'We are leaning on somebody coming through town,' which sits along Interstate 90, a major east-west artery, Magers said.",

Instead of calling 911, a wounded Martinez took to the social media app Snapchat, sharing a photo of himself in a white chef's coat spattered with blood. The caption stated matter of factly: 'I just got shot.' The Internet-savvy college student did not stop there and continued documenting his harrowing ordeal.

        "input_text": "Imagine playing a game of Pictionary with a group of Oxford University students who are unable to recognise the Taj Mahal, the Pyramids or the Eiffel Tower. Welcome to the parallel universe of North Korea, where some of the hermit kingdom's brightest young minds have a lack of worldly knowledge which would shame a Western primary school student. In 2011 writer and journalist Suki Kim went undercover for two terms teaching English at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, just outside the capital of the world's most secretive country. Scroll down for video . Suki Kim (left), arrived for her first term in North Korea in July 2011 and left at the end of her second shortly after the country's Dear Leader, Kim Jong-Il (right), died in December of that year . Students at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology doing their mandatory morning exercises . Miss Kim taking a class. One student once asked her if it was true everyone in the world spoke Korean. Portraits of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il hang on the wall above the blackboard . Posing as one of the Christian missionaries running the facility, Miss Kim spent months secretly documenting her experiences for a book, 'Without You, There Is No Us: My secret life teaching the sons of North Korea's elite'. The 270 boys aged 19-20 were the offspring of some of the regime's most loyal citizens - some of the few allowed to live in the capital outside of which the vast majority are stuck in grinding poverty in the countryside. Their new teacher was getting up at 5am every day to write-up notes she had taken on her experiences, making sure she copied everything to five USB sticks and left nothing on her laptop which could be spied on by her hosts. If Miss Kim, then aged 40, had been caught, she risked being branded a spy and being thrown in one of North Korea's gulags, or forced labour camps, where 120,000 political prisoners are thought to be held. Every piece of material for every lesson had to be submitted and approved for use by a shadowy group known as the 'counterparts' - North Korean staff overseeing the lessons of the foreign teachers who had been brought in. Students on a cold and snowy day after an exam, with the Kimilsungism Study Hall in the background . Miss Kim wrote her book (left) after months of secret note-taking. The Juche Tower in Pyongyang (right) An enclosed walkway that connects all buildings at the PUST campus, including the classroom building on the left. A Pyongyang smokestack belches fumes in the distance . By Miss Kim's second week the counterparts had approved various games, including trivia contents, spelling competitions and Pictionary. And yet, for North Korea's best and brightest, 'photos of the United Nations, the Taj Mahal and the Great Pyramids of Giza elicited only blank expressions'. They knew about Bill Gates from their previous universities, but had no idea how Mark Zuckerberg and the website he created, Facebook, had revolutionised the way the rest of the world communicated. Miss Kim wrote: 'A few guessed the names of the Eiffel Tower and Stonehenge, but only after much hemming and hawing. 'Hardly anyone knew what country had first landed men on the moon, despite the fact that they were science and technology majors. 'Asked what year computers had been invented, most had no idea; it was only after much consultation that one team ventured a guess: 1870.' Miss Kim told MailOnline: 'In a way, why would they know? They have never been taught about the outside world. Three uniformed students on guard duty outside the IT building. The sign reads: 'The Sun of the 21st Century, General Kim Jong-Il' Students on sports day with the Forever Tower to the right, on which is inscribed 'Our Great Leaser is Always With Us' Students often watched from their dormitory windows while Miss Kim practiced playing basketball below . 'They didn't even know about the existence of the internet. There is only one TV channel about the Great Leader and one newspaper about the Great Leader [North Koreans' term for Kim Il-Sung, the country's founder and first leader, who is considered to be immortal and the country's 'Eternal President']. 'But on another level they were the elite. If any of them did know more the fear and the consequences of being exposed were so great they never let it be known.' One student asked Miss Kim if it were true that everyone in the world spoke Korean, as it was 'so superior that they spoke it in England, China and America.' Many of the boy's families lived as little as 10 minutes drive away in Pyongyang, but they were hardly ever allowed to see them or have any contact at all during term time. One student's father stopped by the campus to see him but was turned away and all he could do was leave a note. Another was late for lunch one day because his mother had come to the gate with rice cakes and roast chicken as it was his birthday. Miss Kim wrote: 'He was an only child, and she wept during their twenty-minute meeting, so he told her, \"If you keep crying, I am going to go back inside.\" 'He was laughing as he said this before his friends, but his eyes watered.' Miss Kim in the classroom with the lyrics of a North Korean song which she translated with her students . Eating instant ramen outside the Seventh Pyongyang Autumn International Trade Fair on a rare outing . All the students wore lapel pins featuring the face of Kim Il-Sung. Even during the bitterly cold winter months, groups of six students at a time dressed in martial uniforms were expected to stand guard all night outside the campus's hulking grey Kimilsungism Study Hall. It is where they went to study Juche, Kim Il-Sung's pseudo philosophy of self reliance, and many performed such duties outside similar halls in the areas they grew up in since they were teenagers. Miss Kim is unnerved by the extent to which her students lied, be it about the myriad achievements of Kim Jong-Il, the country's 'Dear Leader' at the time, or what they had been up to that morning. She said: 'It's a whole world of lies. Coming from a world where everything is a lie in some ways it's just been ingrained but they also lie because they are constantly being watched. 'The system has an absolute hold. They lie to protect the system from the outside and also out of fear. 'They were lovely at the same time and also very sincere but their system is a system built on lies.' A highlight of Miss Kim's time at PUST was when she fought successfully so that one of her classes could watch Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Students taking part in their final exam. One class was ecstatic at being allowed to watch Harry Potter . The sign on this building in the capital reads 'We are happy'. Downtown Pyongyang was only around 10 minutes drive from PUST, but students were never allowed out to visit their families during term time . She said: 'They loved it. Most of them had never seen a Western film. They related to Hermione and Ron and saw that they were \"just like us; in school like us; with homework to do like us\". 'That I found very moving. They were never allowed to see the outside world and be exposed to a world that isn't about the Great Leader . 'It was probably the first time they related to Western people in a normal way.' But Miss Kim does not see much hope for the international pariah state opening up to the world any time soon, given what she saw of its system. She said: 'I hope that things will open up even a tiny bit so the boys would be able to find out about my book - that's my biggest wish. 'But I am not that hopeful for real change because the amount of control I saw there was so absolute and so brutal, with no mercy. 'I thought the elites had it a better than everyone else.

Michelle Hutchison, the site's money expert, claims that the booming Internet TV market is littered with traps and Netflix isn't really worth it, yet. 'With the recent launch of Netflix and other providers in Australia, there is a lot of hype about the value of streaming TV shows and movies over the internet,' she said. 'But is it really worth it? 'Buying Netflix is a bad idea .. because you won't get some of the biggest shows like The Walking Dead and you might not have enough data to download the \"unlimited\" shows,' she said.

Ms Hutchison also claims that: 'It could damage the Australian film and TV industry and you won't be able to watch it on your TV unless it's hooked up to a computer or Apple TV or Google chromecast.' 'Netflix and other internet TV providers pose a concerning threat to Australia's already struggling film and TV industry, as more Australians will make the mass migration off free-to-air and pay TV and onto this new way of viewing. 'If fewer Aussie eyeballs are on traditional TV, the stations will struggle to compete with licencing and potentially close up shop for good.

'Netflix (like the others) is a metered video streaming service so your allowed usage will be affected,' Finder reports. 'Keep in mind that streaming in HD uses a higher bandwidth and will affect your usage at a faster rate than watching videos in standard definition will. 'They are fairly similar in price but what you get for that price can differ quite significantly. Besides the difference in TV shows, for the packages $10 and under, some have from 1 and up to 3 devices you can stream shows at the same time.

The price variations amongst the providers are indicative of a number of features that you should investigate and consider before making a choice: . In most cases, the Internet TV offerings, will eat into download quotas. 'You will need to contact your Internet Service Provider in order to find out which ones,' she added. 'For example, some companies allow for unmetered viewing of catch-up TV programming like that offered by ABC’s iView. 'With other providers that are metered you should note that a 60 minute program can potentially consume up to 300MB of data. 'When making the switch to Internet television you also need to consider how well your devices and the platform are able to stream videos. If your Internet connection is too slow, TV shows and movies will not stream to your device continuously. 'Instead, you will be left waiting while the device struggles to catch up. Some content, like HD, also requires a higher speed connection then others.' Netflix has, however, structured agreements with iinet and Optus offering unmetered access. But it's not all bad news, Finder said while there is no value for money for the grown-ups viewing pleasure, parents could save thousands of dollars on children’s entertainment, including DVDs and pay TV subscriptions, with the Australian launch. It has found that the cost of buying all 213 kids TV shows available on Netflix would cost an estimated $4,221.76, which equates to 469 months or 39 years worth of the basic Netflix monthly subscription of $8.99. Netflix launched in Australia on 24 March from AU$8.99 a month for a basic package . Aussie actor Ben Mendelsohn pictured at the 'Bloodline' Netflix TV Series premiere . The launch of Netflix ushers in what is arguably the biggest change to the Australian TV landscape in decades. But the online streaming services will still have to convince Australians - who are among the most prolific illegal downloaders in the world - to pay for content. This could prove difficult, with a new Canstar Blue survey finding that the majority of Australians are still not willing to pay for TV content. About one in five are willing to pay up to $20 a month for a service that provides a majority of content they would like to see. But this could change in future, with the survey also finding that 23 per cent of young Australians are already utilising online streaming services.",

        "input_text": "Aimee Griffiths, 30, (pictured) told her two children to lie down and go to sleep as she started the blaze at their home in Ruabon, Wrexham . A mother-of-two set fire to the home she was being evicted from in a bid to kill herself and her two young children after hearing voices. Aimee Griffiths, 30, of Ruabon, Wrexham, told her two children to lie down and go to sleep as she started the blaze. But her 10-year-old daughter ran out of the house as the fire began to spread and raised the alarm. Heroically her neighbours - both in their sixties - were able to get Griffiths and her seven-year-old son out of the burning house despite Griffiths fighting to stay inside with the boy. She was 'grabbed by the scruff of her neck' and dragged out - and even then tried to get back in. Griffiths has now been jailed for five years and four months at Mold Crown Court after she admitted arson. Judge David Hale told her that what she did in the early hours of August 27 last year 'defied belief'. 'You were clearly intent on killing yourself and your two little children,' he said. 'You were on that day, without doubt, in mental turmoil.' The court heard she had been threatened with eviction and was not in a position to cope with a number of other pressures. The judge said: 'The fact remains that you intended to kill your children and yourself by setting fire to the house. 'If it were not for the tenacity of your daughter, determined to live, you may well have succeeded.' Judge Hale went on to praise the 'heroic intervention' of neighbours William and Eileen Bride. 'They are entitled to a most remarkable thanks from the community for what they did,' he said. The judge said that while on remand at Styal Prison in Cheshire Griffiths had made 'remarkable progress which was all credit to her'. The court heard Griffiths and her family had spent the previous afternoon playing bowls with her sister and friends. Griffiths set fire to the house with her family inside shortly after being told she was facing eviction . But she ended up fighting with her sister while drinking wine before buying another bottle to drink at home which culminated in her starting a number of fires in the early hours of the morning. John Philpotts, prosecuting, said Griffiths told the children to lie on the sofa and that 'everything would be all right'. But her brave daughter refused and ran out of the house to the house next door, the home of Mr and Mrs Bride. Mrs Bride, 62, tried to get into the house and shouted to Griffiths to come out, but Griffiths refused and demanded her daughter go back in. Mr Bride, 66, got into the burning house through the back door, braving thick black smoke to find Griffiths holding her son. The court heard she shouted at him to 'leave my kids alone' but he was able to grab the child and pulled her out of the house by the scruff of her neck. Judge Hale praised the 'heroic intervention' of neighbours William and Eileen Bride (pictured) Once outside, Griffiths had to be restrained from getting back in. The blaze caused £50,000 of damage to the semi-detached property. The court heard that a week earlier Griffiths had been referred to the psychiatric ward at Wrexham Maelor Hospital. Henry Hills, defending, said she had explained that voices were telling her to burn the house but she had been allowed home. He said it was a tragic case and Griffiths had an appalling childhood. DC Mark Griffiths of Wrexham CID said: 'The sentence reflects the seriousness of the incident. Had it not been for the swift actions of neighbours, the events of that night could have ended tragically. 'I'd like to thank members of the public who assisted both on the night and during the course of this investigation which was both complex and distressing.'",

Police were searching for the woman who was stark naked wearing only sunglasses and colorful necklaces in images shared on social media on March 11. The Bay County Sheriff's Office in Florida have not been able to identify the girl and there was not enough background detail in the photographs to pinpoint her location. Sheriff Frank McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that the photos had been deeply concerning to law enforcement because of how young the girl looked, and their main priority was to find out if she was safe. Scroll down for video . Police in Bay County, Florida were searching for a young woman on Spring Break earlier this month who caused concern after being pictured naked wearing only sunglasses and strings of colorful beads while surrounded by men . 'She isn't in trouble,' Sheriff McKeithen said. 'We want to be proactive about her safety.' An investigation was underway into the photographs and how they ended up on social media, the sheriff confirmed. Bay County officials were alerted to the photos after they were posted to Twitter on March 11. In one of the pictures, the young woman was bent over and dancing naked at the water's edge on a beach in the Gulf of Mexico. The Bay County Sheriff’s Office (BCSO) provided a breakdown of criminal activity between March 5 - 15 this year, with three weeks of Spring Break still to go: . In a separate shot, she appeared to be trying to cover her body while a group of men gathered around her. In another picture, the scene was more aggressive. The girl appeared to be trying to escape the frame but was surrounded by shirtless men. One of the men was grabbing the necklaces at her throat. Anyone with information has been asked to contact the Bay County Sheriff's Office at 850-747-4700 or Crime Stoppers at 850-785-TIPS (8477). Panama City Beach in Bay County is the country's top destination for students on Spring Break. Sheriff McKeithen told Daily Mail Online on Friday that his officers, along with the Panama City Beach Police, face an overwhelming wave of criminal activity during the five weeks of Spring Break, when their community swells from 12,000 people to an estimated 100-300,000. 'We have a mess here... this is not the traditional Spring Break of the past,' the sheriff said. 'The kids themselves are posting videos of them having sex on the beach and getting into fights.' He called Spring Break an 'emotional roller coaster' both for the students who end up victims of violence and sexual assault and for his officers, who work double shifts to cope with the influx. 'The majority of sexual assaults are not reported, because they feel shame, are embarrassed, have never likely been this intoxicated before and are far from home,' the police chief said. 'But our message is this - no matter how intoxicated you are, if you are violated, we take that very seriously.' Although the sheriff offered no exact figures on the cost of policing Spring Break, he said that the $150,000 given in assistance by the Tourist Development Council 'barely scratched the surface'. The crowd packed the beach during Spring Break festivities in Panama City Beach, Florida on March 12. Bay County authorities believe that the naked, young woman was on a beach somewhere in this area . Along with hundreds of thousands of drunk, college kids pouring into the town, there was also the dangerous elements that a group this large, with money to burn and wanting to experiment, attraced. 'Build it and they will come,' the sheriff said. Among 22 people arrested at a local bar this weekend in a narcotics sting, was a 39-year-old man from Nashville, Tennessee, who was selling the synthetic party drug, known as 'molly'. Heroin and prescription drugs have also been seized. Weapons were also a growing problem - arrests had uncovered a Glock and an AK-47 during Spring Break. McKeithen said earlier this week that the number of incidents so far this year showed the changes designed to tone down Spring Break haven't worked. These included a 2am closing time for alcohol sales. Sheriff McKeithen said: 'We can't ''police it'' away, that's not going to fix the problem. We are doing the best we can. At some point, someone has to decide whether this is what we want or don't want. 'I am trying to keep people and our officers safe.' If you know who this is email tips@dailymail.co.uk .

        "input_text": "The real-life 'Up' house, which saw its elderly owner refuse to take $1million from developers to move out looks set to be demolished by a wrecking ball when it is auctioned off. In 2006, Edith Macefield took a stand against developers by staying in the house in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood where she had lived in for almost 60 years despite being offered money to leave so new retail and office space could be created. Both she and the 1,000 square foot house became a symbol of standing up to corporate giants after developers were forced to awkwardly build around it. Scroll down for video . The house was often compared to the house in the Pixar movie 'Up' where an elderly man refuses to leave his house to go into a nursing home so turns it into an airship by attaching balloons to it . The world famous 'holdout house' where an elderly woman took a stand against developers forcing them to build around her home, is to be auctioned off this Friday . In 2006 Edith Macefield, 84, was offered $1 million in cash and help with healthcare and housing to sell her home to developers of a retail center in the Seattle neighborhood of Ballard . The story mirrored the plot of the Disney Pixar movie Up, which sees an elderly man refuse to leave his house to go into a nursing home so he turns it into a makeshift airship by attaching balloons to it. However, Ms Macefield passed away from pancreatic cancer in June 2008, leaving the house boarded up and empty. Tomorrow it will be entered into a foreclosure auction, where it is expected to be bought by developers and demolished. It comes after a friend she left the house to sold it to a company called Reach Returns, who planned to keep it in tact for a new project. But when the company started work, they weren't able to get the financing they needed and defaulted on their loans, meaning it went into foreclosure. The row with developers came after the neighborhood of Ballard, just across Salmon Bay from Seattle, held out against the forces of gentrification until 2000 when developers came knocking. Condominiums and shopping malls for tech-industry workers began to spring up where once modest family homes had once stood. By 2006, Ms Macefield's home stood almost alone, her neighbors long gone, as developers prepared to build Ballard Blocks, a retail and office development. She was offered $1 million in cash for her property, in addition to assistance with housing and healthcare. But she turned down the money for the simple reason that she did not want to leave. Macefield refused to leave her home of 50 years, and construction began on the development that would end up surrounding her house and garden . Ms Macefield had lived in the house for almost 60 years, having originally moved there in 1952 to take care of her ailing mother. It was home to all of her memories, and a large collection of ceramic cats, dogs and cows. The money meant nothing to her, she did not want to move, and had already rejected a smaller buyout offer a couple of years before. As concrete walls began to tower some five floors high above her home, her fame grew and she earned the grudging respect of the construction workers that would pass by every day. Ms Macefield never had to leave her home, and she died there aged 86, leaving the small house sandwiched between a Trader Joe's and an L.A. Fitness. Ironically, she left the house to the supervisor of the very project that had tried to displace her. Barry Martin was one of several construction workers that got to know Ms Macefield, often dropping in to check on her. 'She would get up really early to feed the birds every day,' Mr Martin told Yahoo Homes. 'And so if we ever didn't see birdseed out front by 10 am, we'd know to go check on her.' As concrete walls began to tower above her home, her fame grew and she earned the grudging respect of the construction workers that would pass by every day . Macefield never had to leave her home, and she died there aged 86, leaving the small house sandwiched between a Trader Joe's and an L.A. Fitness. Mr Martin would even drive her to hair appointments, run errands, cook for her and take her to hospital. She was tough and stubborn and would test Mr Martin, but he could be too and did not stop looking after her. 'All she wanted to do was live and die in her house, and that seems like a pretty simple request. And all she really needed was some help using her hands and being on her feet,' he said. Ms Macefield, a very private person, did not like the worldwide attention she received for just wanting to stay put in her home. She stood her ground not because she was standing up to corporate America or because she wanted to be a hero. She simply didn't want to leave. 'Some people still believe that she was doing it to stand up against the man, and that really wasn't it. 'She decided what it was she wanted to do and stuck to her guns, and that part to me makes sense. That's what I relate to,' said Mr Martin. The house is now boarded up ahead of the auction at the end of the week, where it is expected to face demolition by a wrecking ball . Macefield was a reluctant folk hero with a colorful past. She claimed she was not trying to make a stand against corporate America. She simply didn't want to leave . The story of the house came at the end of a remarkable life according to stories she told Mr Martin, some of which he was able to corroborate through letters and photographs he found after her death. Ms Macefield had a large musical collection, and played the clarinet. She talked of playing with jazz and swing musician Benny Goodman, her cousin, and his friends Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. She had lived overseas in her early life, could quote from classic books, and spoke multiple languages. She also claimed to have worked as a spy during World War II, until she was captured and sent to the concentration camp at Dachau, from which she then escaped. Later she ran an orphanage for war refugees before returning to America to look after her mother. Despite shunning the limelight she has been immortalized in Seattle due to her refusal of the developer's money. Some two dozen people are reported to have tattoos of her house; a drink is named after her at a local cocktail bar; and the Macefield music festival still attracts a crowd of 3,000 people each year.",

Speaking to 9News , Ms Kowalski said her family were living in hell at the moment . Mr Kowalski's ute was found  on a deserted highway in remote South Australia today, three months after he vanished. Reports from his family suggest his ute has been found bogged in scrubland. He withdrew $800 from his account and hasn't been heard from since. The tradesman's white Holden Rodeo ute was discovered by local workers in scrubland about 95 kilometres south west of Coober Pedy, South Australian Police confirmed on Wednesday. Mr Kowalski had claimed that he planned to stay at the Victoria towns of Wilsons Promontory or Leongatha until December 19 before he set off on his road trip. However, police now believe he may have instead been heading for  Darwin in the Northern Territory. The car is being transported to Coober Pedy to be examined by South Australian Police in a bid to discover what happened to Mr Kowalski. Inspector Ian Humby said that Police were intensifying their search for any information on Mr Kowalski's whereabouts. Vera Kowalski is holding out hope that her son Dane is till alive . In attempt to find Dane, friends have set up a website and started a social media campaign, as well as printing shirts and stickers with his face on them . 'Today, with assistance of SES and CFS together with STAR Group, we'll be doing searching in the vicinity between the Stuart Highway and the location where the car was found, doing searches in that whole vicinity trying to find any evidence we can to try and find out where he might be,' Mr Humby said on Thursday. 'We're also examining the car and any of its contents for any information that might help.' 'At this time there does not appear to be any suspicious circumstances.' His family and friends have led a tireless campaign to bring Dane home and have spoken out after the latest development. 'Dane's car has been found in scrub land off the Stuart Highway in South Australia,' his family and friends wrote on their Facebook page, set up to help locate their missing mate. The tradesman's white Holden Rodeo ute was discovered by local workers in scrubland about 95 kilometres south west of Coober Pedy, South Australian Police confirmed on Wednesday . Desperate: Mr Kowalski's friends and family have launched a widespread search in which they have retraced his footsteps from Victoria to Darwin and handed out hundreds of missing posters . 'It appears he got bogged. 'Dane's family and some close friends are heading to Coober Pedy now to assist and search. We all have fingers crossed and are praying this enables us to bring Dane home. 'Please keep all speculation to yourselves'. The Melbourne man's loved ones said they were focussing of remaining hopeful after the car was uncoverd. 'We are all overwhelmed with emotion and want to thank everyone for their love prayers and support. 'Good luck boys and Danes family lets ‪#‎bringdanehome!! They also posted a photo of Mr Kowalski jumping for joy on their Facebook site as his loved one's board a plane to continue their search. According to a Facebook post on the 'Find Dane' Facebook page, it appears the vehicle became bogged . After Dane's car was found his friends posted this photo on Facebook, captioned, 'We're coming to find you Dane. We'll never give up hope. Time to bring you home, mate' The photo was captioned, 'We're coming to find you Dane. We'll never give up hope. Time to bring you home, mate'. His friends and family have spent the past month retracing his steps from Melbourne to Darwin looking for signs of Dane and putting up hundreds of missing person posters along the way. They have vowed not to stop until they find him. In attempt to find Dane, friends have set up a website and started a social media campaign, as well as printing shirts and stickers with his face on them. One of Dane's best friends, who has been friends with him since the age of 12, is so desperate to find him that he has offered a $25,000 reward from his own pocket for any information. Dane hasn't touched his phone, bank account or social media accounts since he went missing . For three months his friends have campaigned tirelessly, imploring everybody to spread the message about Dane's strange and distressing disappearance . Brittany Taylor, the partner of Dane's best friend Anthony Hudson, told Daily Mail Australia that the missing man's family and friends were beside themselves with worry. 'No one has heard a word. There's been nothing since then (December 12); his phone hasn't been touched, his bank account hasn't been touched, social media – nothing,' Ms Taylor said. 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's birthday, some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character. It's not unusual for him to travel, but it is unusual for him not to check in. 'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.' His friends and family have considered hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search. Any sign, big or small, leading people to their website or raising awareness is necessary . Dane Kowalski, 27, left his Diamond Creek home in Victoria on December 12 for a fishing trip in Darwin . 'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home. If someone knows something or they've seen something - we're desperate,' Ms Taylor said. One of the many psychics, who responded to the social media campaign, told Dane's family that he may have stopped to help someone whose car was hit by a kangaroo before a scuffle broke out and his car was taken. It's just one of the many lead's his desperate family has followed up, including checking road tolls and phone records. Ms Taylor and the rest of Mr Kowalski's friends and family have issued a plea of help to the public to help them find him. 'We don't think it's likely at all, but if he wants to be left alone we just want him to let us know he's okay. He's so missed and so loved and we're doing everything we can to get him home,' Ms Taylor said. 'Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess, everyone's doing everything they can, everyone's breaking down and trying to support each other.' 'He's one of the most amazing people you'll ever meet; he'd give you everything he had if he knew he could help you. You can't say a bad word about him, you really can't. He really loves life.' There has been no trace of the 27-year-old since that day: His phone and bank accounts remaining untouched . 'He's missed Christmas, his god-daughter's (pictured) birthday - some really vital things that we knew he was looking forward to. It's so out of character...Everyone's beside themselves: his mum is not coping at all, everyone's a mess,' Brittany Taylor, the partner of Mr Kowalski's best friend Anthony Hudson, said .

He was driving a white 2004 Holden Rodeo ute with the registration WN114. Anyone who sees Dane is urged to contact Triple Zero (000) immediately. The enormous search effort for Mr Kowalski has involved police, psychics, missing posters, a social media campaign, a website and various fundraisers. Now, his friends and family are considering hiring a plane in Darwin for a more thorough search. Four of the much-loved man's friends returned home two days ago after driving from Melbourne to Darwin, handing out missing posters and looking for signs of their missing friend. They flew back to Darwin on New Year's Day to continue their search. 'My partner put that reward money - $25,000 - out of his own pocket. He's desperate to have his best friend back home.

The paving worker from Homestead, Florida was napping in his work car nearly two years ago, waiting for two co-workers to finish drinking at a bar in Marathon when a drunk patron came outside and set the propane tanks in the back of the truck on fire. Surveillance footage shows the moment then 26-year-old Stuart Collins pulled out a Bic lighter and sparked the flame that then engulfed the truck in flames. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES: Scroll down for video . Life changed completely: Jose Gonzalez of Homestead, Florida received third-degree burns to 68 per cent of his body in a July 2013 attack by a stranger . Spark: The 53-year-old was sleeping in his work truck, waiting for two coworkers to finish up drinking at a Marathon, Florida bar when a drunk man came out and set propane tanks in the back of the vehicle on fire . Engulfed in flames: The married father-of-one woke up to flames eating away at his clothes, and was on fire for an excruciating 11 minutes . Suspect: Stuart Collins, now 29, was arrested for setting the car on fire. He is being held on $1.05 million bond for charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief . Gonzalez says he woke up to his clothes on fire, but was lucky enough to escape the truck by himself before help arrived. However, the flames had spread too fast and he suffered covered in fire for 11 minutes - leaving him with third-degree burns on 68 per cent of his body. Gonzalez spent the following six months after the July 12, 2013 attack in the hospital, going in and out of a coma while he underwent some 15 surgeries. 'It changed everything. I am a useless man on a bed,' Gonzalez said in Spanish to CBS Miami. 'Why did he do this? We don't know each other. He did this for no reason,' Gonzalez said of Collins. 'It seems like he just became enraged and lit the truck on fire and unfortunately I was inside sleeping and he set me on fire. It changed my life forever.' Now he's speaking out as he plans to file a lawsuit against the owners of J.J.'s Doghouse, the bar that continued to serve Collins. 'If there would have been security, this could have been avoided and I wouldn't be burnt,' Gonzalez told Local 10. The Gonzalez family's lawyer Jason Brenner cited surveillance footage which shows Collins entering the bar that night, claiming the video proves the young man was clearly intoxicated. Lawsuit: The Gonzalez family plans to sue the bar that continued to serve Collins. Collins seen above in a white shirt, stumbling around, in surveillance footage from just before the explosion . Fault: Gonzalez says if J.J.'s Doghouse had security protocols in place, they might have prevented Collins from causing harm . Charred: Above, a photo released by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office shows the charred remains of Gonzalez's work truck . 'This was a very small bar in terms of space, and where this incident took place, it was but three feet from the back door, and this was an area where people always hung out,' Brenner told WSVN. 'When you see in the video, when this man got out of the cab, he was extremely intoxicated and identified by the bartender. He had erratic and aggressive behavior throughout the evening.' Collins told police he only had two rum and Cokes and three beers in a six-hour span that night. The now 29-year-old was arrested after the incident and is being held on $1.05 million bond at the Monroe County Jail on charges of attempted second-degree murder, second-degree arson and criminal mischief. He has plead not guilty to the charges ahead of his trial, which is expected to start in June. Painful: Following the attack, Gonzalez spend six months in the hospital and underwent 15 surgeries .

Forever dependent: Gonzalez is now relies on his wife and teenage son to take care of him . Happier times: Above, Gonzalez pictured before the attacks. Alone on the left, and with his wife of 21 years on the right . Meanwhile, Gonzalez is in his own form of prison due to to the injuries which have left him completely dependent on his wife and teenage son, and will likely never work again. That has put a serious strain on the family, since his wife also lost her job as a vice principal. 'It's gone from me being able to do pretty much whatever I want with my dad to not being able to do very much at all,' his son Jose Gonzalez Jr said. 'In fact, I have to do most things for him along with my mother.' In addition to the planned lawsuit against J.J.'s Doghouse, the Gonzalez family settled another lawsuit against the property's owner but the terms were kept confidential.",

        "input_text": "Tributes are pouring in for former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser, the giant of Australian politics who died aged 84 on Friday morning. His office issued a statement confirming the news 'with deep sadness', saying he had suffered only a 'brief illness'. 'We appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him, but ask that the family be left in peace at this difficult time,' it said. Mr Fraser was prime minister from November 1975 until March 1983. He controversially came to power as caretaker prime minister following the dismissal of Labor leader Gough Whitlam by Governor-General Sir John Kerr. Mr Fraser's party had blocked the supply of money for the government in the Senate, forcing the constitutional crisis. Gough Whitlam would dub Fraser 'Kerr's cur', although, perhaps in a sign of Mr Fraser's compassion, the two would have a rapprochement later in life. Under his leadership, the Coalition then won the largest landslide of any political party at the 1975 federal election. Prime Minister Tony Abbott today hailed Mr Fraser's service, acknowledging him and Mr Whitlam as 'fierce Australian patriots'. 'Malcolm Fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of Australia... He was rightly proud of his government.' Scroll down for video . Malcolm Fraser was prime minister from November 1975 until March 1983. He was elected to federal Parliament when he was just 25 . In a statement, Malcolm Fraser's office said:' It is with deep sadness that we inform you that after a brief illness John Malcolm Fraser died peacefully in the early hours of the morning of 20 March 2015' You can call me (caretaker) Prime Minister: Malcolm Fraser strides down the steps of Old Parliament House, on the day Gough Whitlam was dismissed . Divisive: The method in which Malcolm Fraser rose to power did not endear him to much of the population during the politically turbulent period of the 1970s . Fraser's government won the largest majority of any party at any federal election in 1975 . In office, Mr Fraser championed a multicultural Australia, delivered self-government to the Northern Territory and established SBS and the Australian Federal Police. He was determined in confronting the 'evil' of apartheid in South Africa and began to develop economic reforms that would change the country. Following his defeat by Labor's Bob Hawke in 1983, Mr Fraser became known as an outspoken advocate of asylum seekers. He became critical of the Liberal Party - later resigning his membership - and his opinions, often broadcast on Twitter in his later years, tended to run against the grain of the modern party. Treasurer Joe Hockey told reporters: 'He supplied stability and re-assurance at a time where Australia had experienced much upheaval. 'I think history will be kinder to Malcolm Fraser than many of his critics have over the years. 'It is with deep sadness that we inform you that after a brief illness John Malcolm Fraser died peacefully in the early hours of the morning of 20 March 2015. 'We appreciate that this will be a shock to all who knew and loved him, but ask that the family be left in peace at this difficult time'. Mr Fraser's party had blocked the supply of money for the government in the Senate, forcing the 1975 constitutional crisis . 'The night Malcolm Fraser lost his trousers': The former prime minister's most embarrassing moment came about in 1986, when he was found confused and dressed only in a towel at Memphis hotel frequented by prostitutes and drug dealers . Malcolm Fraser's former treasurer and eventual successor, John Howard, praised his 'dominance' of the Liberal Party . Former leaders: Australia's seven surviving prime ministers past and present posed for a photograph at Gough Whitlam's memorial service last year. Now Malcolm Fraser is no longer among their number. From left to right: Mr Fraser, Julia Gillard, Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott, John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating . Beloved: Malcolm Fraser is pictured here earlier this year with his wife Tamie Fraser. The pair had four children . Following his defeat by Labor's Bob Hawke in 1983, Mr Fraser continued to be an outspoken advocate of asylum seekers . Former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd honoured Mr Fraser as a Liberal leader in the tradition of Alfred Deakin, the country's second leader. 'All Australians will recall Mr Fraser’s role in the controversy surrounding the dismissal in 1975,' he added. 'This cannot be erased from history. 'Prime Minister Fraser will be remembered as a compassionate Australian, who cared for people at home or abroad, who had little or nothing to protect them. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said: 'Mr Fraser a politician of principle and leader of compassion. A true gentleman with a heart full of empathy. I am devastated.' The Australian flag is flying at half-mast at Parliament House. He is survived by his wife, Tamie, and their four children. Malcolm Fraser was first elected to federal Parliament for his seat of Wannon when he was just 25 . Our country has lost its 22nd Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser. As our nation’s leader between 1975 and 1983, he restored economically responsible government while recognising social change. In a long and active retirement, he maintained a keen interest in our country’s direction. The constitutional crisis of 1975 was one of the defining political events of our nation. Malcolm Fraser held true to the belief that his actions were in the best interests of Australia. He was determined to ‘turn on the lights’ and restore Australia’s economic fortunes. The greatest win in Australian political history confirms that he had correctly read the mood of the public. The friendship he built in later life with Gough Whitlam spoke volumes about the character of both men at the centre of the crisis: in their own different ways, they were both fierce Australian patriots. Under Malcolm Fraser’s leadership, self-government was conferred on the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth Ombudsman was established and our first Freedom of Information laws were enacted. Following the Hilton bombing, he established the Australian Federal Police. Later, he introduced legislation to establish a crimes commission following the Costigan Royal Commission. He commissioned the Campbell Report of 1981 which laid the foundations for eventual deregulation of the financial system. Under Malcolm Fraser’s leadership, Australia was an unwavering opponent of apartheid and after he left office, Malcolm Fraser continued to work for the end of apartheid. His subsequent appointment to roles with the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Nations reflected his high international standing. He had a deep interest in the advancement of indigenous people. He banned sand mining on Fraser Island. As well, the first Australian sites were placed on the World Heritage List and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park was declared. He welcomed the re-settlement of tens of thousands of Vietnamese people in Australia who have subsequently added a rich, new dimension to our national life. He was rightly proud of his government. As he said when he conceded defeat: Australia is handed over… in as good a condition or better condition than any other Western country in the world.",

        "input_text": "Embattled Whole Pantry founder Belle Gibson has expressed concern over her family's safety in her first comments to media since she admitted her terminal cancer may have been 'misdiagnosed'. In an interview with Daily Mail Australia, Ms Gibson claimed her son's childcare details, her home address and floor plan had been posted online amidst the fierce  backlash against her. She said that was the reason 'police came to our home checking in on my safety' last week. Ms Gibson also hit out at some of her critics, saying that while she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion', some people had responded 'maliciously'. Belle Gibson: Doubt has been cast on the Whole Pantry founder's stories as people demand answers from the health guru . Doting young mum: Ms Gibson has expressed concern about her family's safety after her son's childcare details were allegedly placed online . Ms Gibson's remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The Whole Pantry, a popular app, gained media attention because of Ms Gibson's remarkable story about cancer survival . 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. The Instagram star did not address questions concerning her cancer diagnosis, saying she would 'have a statement live this week' where she would address medical questions. 'Our address being posted online to a website... is not OK,' she said, providing Daily Mail Australia with screenshots of her address posted on Facebook. 'I do think it's important for myself and the company to recognise everyone's anger and confusion surrounding this last week, though this doesn't justify how others have perpetuated this or responded so maliciously.' She has not provided evidence of her childcare or floor plan claims at time of publication. Her remarks came during a devastating 24 hours for her business, with local publisher Penguin Books and a U.S. publishing house dumping Ms Gibson's Whole Pantry recipe book. The book had been written in conjunction with her hugely successful app of the same name, which is set to feature on the Apple Watch. The app gained popularity after Ms Gibson claimed she warded off a terminal brain cancer diagnosis through diet and a holistic approach to life. But after close friends last week cast doubt on these claims, Ms Gibson herself admitted in an interview with The Australian that an announcement last year that her cancer had spread to her liver, spleen, blood and uterus was a 'misdiagnosis'. Ms Gibson explained why she today wiped all her remaining photos from her Instagram account - some had already been removed - and had the Whole Pantry Facebook page deleted. 'At the end of the day, I am a human being on the receiving end of comments, questions and emails and even if the public are used to a digital interaction with me, it does not warrant some of the recent responses,' she said. The Whole Pantry was voted Apple’s Best Food and Drink App of 2013 and will feature on the Apple Watch. The technology giant did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's requests for comment on Tuesday . She said the social media accounts were 'further encouraging interactions between those who were angry and encouraging personal data, information or other security-sensitive content to be shared or made light of. 'My son's childcare details were posted online in the midst of this, so I'm sure you can understand how unnecessary, concerning and threatening that is.' Ms Gibson said the statement she was writing was taking 'longer than anticipated' because of media requests and 'constantly arising issues', 'with the paramount focus being protecting the safety of myself and my son'. Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they visited an Elwood home last Tuesday evening 'as part of a welfare check. They left shortly after with nil concerns.' Some of Ms Gibson's former followers have taken to social media to try to 'expose' her - posting images of her drinking alcohol before she became a clean-living star and old claims about her battle with cancer. The  Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page has been sharing images of her sipping beer . Clean-living Belle Gibson, seen here with a pint in her hand, told the friends who have spoken out about her to 'make yourself invisible to me, and my life' The administrators of the Belle Gibson Uncovered Facebook page, which has been sharing images of her sipping beer and champagne and eating vegan doughnuts, said they are doing so because Ms Gibson 'fiercely censors The Whole Pantry Facebook page'. 'The reason is simple, to educate and inform the many people who have already commented on this page feeling betrayed, deceived and let down by someone who they trusted,' they wrote. 'Many people followed this person, they believed in her and some even abandoned conventional medicine in favour of embracing her lifestyle in desperate hope they could cure their illnesses. On Monday afternoon, Australian publisher Penguin said it had been left with 'no other option' but to stop supplying her book in Australia. 'Despite our best endeavours, Penguin Books has not received sufficient explanation from Ms Gibson, author of The Whole Pantry recipe book, in response to recent allegations,' the comapny said in a statement. 'We remain hopeful that we will receive the formal assurances we have requested in the coming days. Ms Gibson has deleted thousands of photos and social media posts which directly reference her multiple cancer diagnoses, but an example of them - seen by Daily Mail Australia - can be found below: . Back in July 2013, Ms Gibson posted on The Whole Pantry Facebook page: 'It's unfortunate that there is someone on my Instagram trying to discredit the natural healing path I am on.' She went on to say: 'As always, with everything, this is my journey and I encourage you to do what is best for your body and situation with love and an open mind. 'I have been healing a severe and malignant brain cancer for the past few years with natural medicine, gerson therapy and foods. 'It’s working for me and I am grateful to be here sharing this journey with over 70,000 people worldwide. Thank you for being here - xx Belle.' In a reference to her liver cancer, she posted on Instagram under her account @healing_belle, a photo of a pink smoothie enriched with 'extra support'. 'This one is for my rash (thanks, liver cancer), inflammation (thanks flying) and for general immunity.' In another Instagram post she wrote: 'Going from 6 weeks to live, to celebrating my fourth year with brain cancer, I know now that respecting your own journey and intuitively healing, listening and living as YOUR body, mind and path intended is staple.' In July 2014, she broke the news of further illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote. About 12 weeks after the initial post she followed up, revealing she was undergoing 'German integrative oncology protocol'. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) is also a popular app, which costs $3.79 to download. The app is slated to appear on the new Apple Watch .",

        "input_text": "Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women prompting her father to slam the system for failing to protect his daughter. The brutal rape and murder of the 29-year-old ABC staffer on her way home from a night out in Brunswick in Melbourne's north in September 2012 rocked the entire nation. His attack on Ms Meagher led to a review of Victoria's parole laws, after he was mistakenly allowed to remain on the streets. Ms Meagher's father, George McKeon, said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was evident from the findings in the report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. Mr McKeon has spoken out following his daughter's killer, who has been described as deriving pleasure from inflicting pain, being convicted of three more rapes - two sex workers and a Dutch backpacker - bringing his number of victims to 12. Scroll down for video . Adrian Ernest Bayley, the sex offender who murdered Jill Meagher, has been found guilty of raping three more women as an expert claims the notorious predator gained pleasure from inflicting pain . The brutal rape and murder of the 29-year-old ABC staffer on her way home from a night out in Brunswick in Melbourne's north in September 2012 rocked the entire nation . Ms Meagher's father George McKeon (right) with on Jill's wedding day with her cousin Louise McKeon (left) said the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community . Ms Meagher's murder triggered a parole system review by retired High Court judge Ian Callinan, who released his findings in July 2013. Bayley was released from prison on parole in 2010, but that should have been cancelled after he was convicted of assaulting a man in February 2012. Instead he appealed the assault charge and was released on bail, leaving him free to rape the 25-year-old, the backpacker and kill Ms Meagher. Ms Meagher's father George McKeon said although nothing could bring back his daughter, it was clear from the Callinan report that the Victorian Parole Board failed to protect his daughter and many others in the community. 'As a family, we have until now been very mindful not to make any statement or take any actions that might delay the outstanding criminal proceedings against Gillian's murderer,' McKeon said in a statement. 'However now that these proceedings are completed, we want to try and obtain closure and to ensure that other families don't have to endure this trauma.' 'In particular as a family we would like to: . 'A - Continue to raise awareness of the systemic problem of violence against women, an issue we as a family and Tom Meagher, in particular, is very closely associated with in both his writings and his role as an ambassador for the White Ribbon Campaign. 'B - Ensure that the proposed Coronial Inquest into the circumstances of Gillian's death does not proceed. Following the Callinan Report, the 20 May 2013 amendments to The Corrections Act 1986 (Vic) and the criminal proceeding in relation to her murder, we see little to be learned or gained from an open Inquest into her death.' The coroner removing Ms Meagher's body found on Black Hill Road in Gisborne South, north of Melbourne, Ausatralia, September 28 2012 . To add to his string of offences, Bayley has been convicted of raping an 18-year-old sex worker in his car in St Kilda in 2000 and a 25-year-old sex worker in April 2012 in eerily near identical circumstances. The 43-year-old also raped a Dutch backpacker in July 2012, just two months before his fatal attack on Ms Meagher, after telling her she was in danger and convincing her to climb into his car for safety. Bayley picked up all three women in St Kilda and drove them to a secluded laneway where he parked with the passenger side door pressed against a fence, blocking their escape. He contested each charge but juries found him guilty in three separate Victorian County Court trials. Suppression orders prohibited media outlets from publishing any details from the rape cases until the third guilty verdict was handed down on Thursday. His defence team argued that the three sexual assault victims had mistaken their attackers for Bayley because he featured heavily in the media spotlight with Ms Meagher's case. Bayley has now been found guilty of raping 10 women and attempting to rape two more. He is currently serving a life sentence with a 35-year-minimum for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012. Bayley was found guilty of raping the 18-year-old in July 2014, but suppression orders prevented reporting of the case until he faced the two other trials this month. Judge Sue Pullen lifted the orders when the final jury returned its verdict on the backpacker's case on Wednesday and will sentence Bayley at a later date. Born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971, he grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall . Ms Meagher's body was found six days after the horrific murder by the hands of Bayley . Born Adrian Ernest Edwards on July 14, 1971, he grew up in Melbourne with four younger siblings and an abusive father, who once smashed his son's head through a wall. Bayley told a prison psychologist he was also sexually abused from age nine to 15 by an older female, though this claim has not been verified. 'There is certainly evidence of physical abuse - in my opinion, some evidence of the possibility of sexual abuse,' psychologist James Ogloff later told a court. Professor Ogloff believes Bayley's borderline personality disorder contributes to his impulsiveness and unstable self image. Bayley fantasises about assuming power and control over his victims, and the psychologist believes he derives pleasure from inflicting pain. His criminal record suggests this is the case. FIRST TRIAL: July 2014 . Victim raped in late 2000 when aged 18 in a laneway in St Kilda. Bayley put his fingers down her throat so she couldn't breathe and threatened to kill her, the ABC reported. She became addicted to heroin at 14 and turned to sex working to supplement her habit. Bayley was her third and last client. SECOND TRIAL: March 2015 . Another sex worker, aged 25, was told by Bayley 12 years later in April 2012 that she needed a pimp to 'look out' for her while he was raping her in the back of his car. He then drove her to a hotel to use the bathroom when Bayley drove away after she refused to get back in the car. THIRD TRIAL: March 2015 . A Dutch backpacker was beckoned by Bayley to get in his car because he said another car was following her while she was walking from a pub in St Kilda to her home to Balaclava in July 2012. The woman was so fearful of dying while being raped that she invited Bayley back to her place where he took a couple of steps into her house but left when he realised her flatmates were home. Bayley is currently serving a life sentence with a 35-year-minimum for the rape and murder of Ms Meagher (pictured as a teenager) in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012 . Bayley picked up all three women in St Kilda and drove them to a secluded laneway where he parked with the passenger side door pressed against a fence, blocking their escape . His first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle, in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed. In June 1991, a 19-year-old Bayley was jailed for five years, with a three-year non-parole period, for raping a teenager and attempting to rape two more women. He spent almost two years in prison before being released in 1993, when he trained as a pastry chef. Bayley had two children with his first wife before they split. He married again, fathering another two children. He changed his last name from Edwards to Bayley in 2000, but returned to violent sexual crime. In the early 2000s there were reports to police that a young, fit man was targeting prostitutes in St Kilda. He was jailed again in April 2002 for 11 years, with minimum of eight, for 16 charges of rape against five victims. He would drive them to a laneway, park so his victims could not escape, and then brutally rape them. Bayley's first rape was committed just months after he walked down the isle, in 1990, and a string of sexual assaults soon followed . When a judge jailed him in 2002, he said Bayley used threats and violence to satisfy his 'gross sexual appetite'. Bayley was released on parole in 2010, and was working as a labourer in 2012 when he attacked again. This time he killed his victim, Jill Meagher. Bayley did appear to be sorry, Prof Ogloff said. Though he said it was quite common for people to be very remorseful but to persist in engaging in that behaviour. Bayley seems to agree. 'They should never have let me out,' Bayley told police after confessing to killing Ms Meagher. 'How many chances does a person need.'",

        "input_text": "A jilted husband has been jailed for almost a year and given a restraining order after rampaging through his former marital home with a chainsaw to reduce its value. These photographs show how Andrew Brooks, 43, destroyed large parts of the property after the £150,000 Lake District cottage was put in the name of his estranged wife Bridget. He took the chainsaw to the majority of external and internal doors, reminiscent of terrifying scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining where star Jack Nicholson hacks through them with an axe. The former soldier had sawn through the property's doors to enter his former home in Marton, near Barrow-in-Furness after a dispute over ownership of the property when his wife left him because he was abusive. Although she was not in the home at the time, Brooks' rampage left Mrs Brooks suffering panic attacks and on prescribed medication because she has been so anxious he might turn up again. On the rampage: Andrew Brooks, 43, has been jailed after he destroyed large parts of a  £150,000 Lake District cottage with a chainsaw after his wife Bridget left him . Kitchen: Brooks began slicing at everything he could see with the aim of reducing the value of the house after it was handed to his wife . Lounge: The father-of-two hacked at two log burners in the house in his trail of destruction last year, which has left him in prison . Revenge: Despite being to blame for the breakdown of their marriage Brooks decided to continue to abuse his wife by destroying their home when it was put in her name . After the house was put in his wife's name he went berserk and chopped it up with a chainsaw. The father-of-two had been desperate for revenge and wanted to knock thousands off the value of the rural property after the collapse of the couple's 14-year marriage. During his £9,000 rampage, Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, three internal doors and an internal beam, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace. At Preston Crown Court, Brooks, now of Eccles, Greater Manchester pleaded guilty to criminal damage and was jailed for 46 weeks. These pictures of the aftermath of the rampage were shown to Judge Jacqueline Beech, who sent him to prison. She told him: 'This was an act of revenge or retribution against your former wife who had the courage to leave the abusive relationship she was in with you'. During the course of that relationship you were physically and emotionally abusive to her and you made her life a misery. Entry: After his ex-wife changed the locks Brooks cut his way in to the cottage through this door by slashing a hole in its bottom panel . Deliberate act: The former soldier had slashed through the majority of the house's doors before the police arrived after neighbours saw him wandering around with a chainsaw . Abuse: Brooks also drove the chainsaw through several cupboards in the house as part of a revenge attack on his ex-wife Bridget . The judge said: 'You were aggrieved about the separation and the sale of the house and equity. You wanted to reduce the value and prospective of a sale by causing damage to it. She has suffered anxiety, panic attacks since the separation from you and has been prescribed medication and has anxiety because by the uncertainty of when you might turn up.' She said reports alleged Brooks had shown 'no remorse' and that he 'continued to blame his wife for the current circumstances'. She added: 'This was a pre-planned offence involving you taking a chainsaw to your former matrimonial home to wreak revenge upon your wife. It was part of the continuing course of conduct whilst there was a restraining order. 'The circumstances of this offence and value of damage caused, means an immediate prison sentence is inevitable. Your conduct was towards the mother of your children.' Earlier the court heard the couple split up in September 2011 and in May 2014 at the matrimonial court, an order was made transferring ownership of the property to Mrs Brooks' name. But Mrs Brooks was said to have had concerns that her former husband would take steps to reduce the value of the property, which was at the time vacant, in revenge for her being awarded the house. As a result the locks on the door were changed and the keys were deposited at the police station so that entry could only be gained by going to the station. The house insurance was also increased by Mrs Brooks. Days later Brooks was seen by a neighbour at the rear of his former address walking around the garden with the chainsaw. He was seen taking the chainsaw in order to remove the panel of the PVC door. He was to say that he had lost his keys and did not want to change the locks before using the chainsaw to gain access into the property. Attack: Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, pictured, three internal doors, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace . Flagrant: Brooks even took his chainsaw to the the beams of the pretty Lake District cottage after becoming bitter about the break-up . Indiscriminate: The former soldier took the chainsaw to the majority of external and internal doors, reminiscent of terrifying scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining where star Jack Nicholson hacks through them with an axe. Brooks had been previously handed a restraining order in September 2012 following two offences of harassment and then two further charges of harassment where he received a community order. The court was told that he had been residing in Manchester with his new partner and his eldest son who he was tutoring in the run up to his GCSEs. It is believed his younger son lives with his mother. In mitigation, Mr Alexander Langhorn asked for his sentence to be suspended and for him to be credited for his early plea. He said that upon leaving school at 16 Brooks had worked in a number of fields including mechanics before joining the Armed Forces serving with a distinction in a number of areas throughout the world. But upon the birth of his second son he left and had worked as a landscape gardener. He added that his client had been 'a positive role model'. Mr Langhorn said: 'He had been very much part of his children's lives and wanted to do the best for them. He knows he has put them at risk. He has been tutoring his son throughout the year, he knows that anything he does now, any sentence he faces, the impact is not only on him but also on his family. It places a double weight.' He added that he was 'a hard worker and provider' and that he had been involved in the community based Dalton Carnival. 'He is a man who goes out of his way to help others.' Brooks must also pay a victim surcharge of £100. The restraining order will run until further notice.",

        "input_text": "A host of the biggest names in the music industry have joined forces to launch Tidal, a streaming service being billed as the first artist-owned platform for music and video. Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West joined a host of other stars as they were revealed as co-owners of the subscription service, which is the brainchild of Jay Z. Unlike rivals Spotify, the service will not have a free tier - meaning the musicians stand to make more money from it. Scroll down for video . Celebrity backing: Jason Aldean, Jack White, Daft Punk, Beyonce, Regine Chassagne, Win Butler, and Alicia Keys onstage at the Tidal launch event on Monday . Selling the product: Quoting Jimmy Hendrix and Nietzsche, Alicia Keys did her best to sell Tidal to fans . The membership-based service - similar to subscription service Spotify - will provide music and exclusive video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. Unlike Spotify there isn't a free service. It is being offered to U.S. users at two price points: about $9.95 for standard sound quality and $19.99 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users. Alicia Keys said the artists hope Tidal will 'forever change the course of music history' and ensure the viability of the industry at Monday's launch event in New York City. The celebrities - which also included Nicki Minaj, Jason Aldean, Usher, Arcade Fire and deadmau5 - stood in a line, and in solidarity by mostly wearing black onstage as Keys spoke to the audience at Skylight at Moynihan Station in Manhattan. Keys called the event 'a graduation.' 'So we come together before you on this day, March 30th, 2015, with one voice in unity in the hopes that today will be another one of those moments in time, a moment that will forever change the course of music history. 'For today we announce of Tidal, the first ever artist-owned, global music and entertainment platform,' Keys said. However, details about the streaming service were vague. The membership-based service - similar to subscription service Spotify - will provide music and exclusive video content that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. Unlike Spotify there isn't a free service. It is being offered to U.S. users at two price points: about $9.95 for standard sound quality and $19.99 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' In the United Kingdom the premium service will set users back £20. Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users. Earlier claims were made that Tidal offers artists double the streaming rates of its rival. However, the firm has confirmed if this is still the case. Signing on: Madonna climbs on the table as she signs a document as one of the high profile co-owners of the new service . The difference means that Tidal offers higher sound quality for audiophiles with advanced sound systems - but that casual listeners using simple laptops or smartphones may face slower connections. The venue for the event was transformed to display a walkway paying tribute to the different decades in music, starting with the 1950s. Coldplay's Chris Martin and Calvin Harris, who both appeared via video, are also co-owners. 'Our mission goes beyond commerce, it goes beyond technology. 'Our intent is to preserve music's importance in our lives,' Keys said. 'Music is the language of love, of laughter, of heartbreak, of mystery. It's the world's true, true, without question, universal language.' Each of the owners signed documents at the event as the audience screamed when they walked to a table in the center of the stage. Star power: Daft Punk line up on stage next to Beyonce; Monday's launch came after a huge social media push, in which the stars devoted their Twitter and Facebook pages to promoting Tidal . Laquan Smith Double Layered French Shorts . A Spring must have! Visit site . If you don't recognize the name Laquan Smith, you'll surely know it now after Beyonce wore an outfit made by the designer to the launch of her husband, Jay-Z's latest venture. The black and white romper had a plunging neckline and a French lace overlay, which the Drunk in Love singer wore over fishnet pantyhose to show off those famous stems. Laquan started his fashion career at the tender age of 19, working with esteemed legends in the industry like stylist Elizabeth Sulcer and Andre Leon Talley. So it only makes sense that the young entrepreneur went on to dress the likes of Rihanna, Lady Gaga, and Queen B herself in his unique and innovative pieces.

Offering curated playlists and 'editorial', Tidal already has deals in place with all the major record labels. It will also work when offline, with users able to 'listen on the subway'. The artists hope the service can compete with platforms including Spotify and Apple's soon-to-be revamped music service involving Beats Music. Streaming - which allows users to play unlimited on-demand music online - has quickly shaken up the industry, narrowly edging out CD sales in revenues last year in the United States. Industry leader Spotify says it has 60 million users with 15 million of them paying - generally $10 a month. Spotify already has a range of rivals including US-based Rhapsody and Google Play. Paris-based Deezer is the second larger service with 6 million customers. It is strong in Europe and last year entered the United States as a high-end-only service. The most recent numbers for Tidal are at 540,000, according to the company. Like Tidal, Deezer's elite service uses FLAC files which are larger than MP3s, which are most common for music. All onboard: Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and Madonna hope to profit from the new service . Apple - which pioneered digital music through iTunes in 2001 - is reportedly also looking to launch a new streaming service as the market shifts away from permanent downloads. Apple earlier made a bid for streaming customers by buying Beats Electronics, run by another rap mogul, Dr. Dre. Along with the United States, Tidal runs in major markets including Britain and France and plans to launch later this year in Australia and Germany. Alicia asked the crowd to: 'think about how many times music has personally picked you up and reminded you that you can do it again.' 'Music speaks to all of us,' she said. 'Music brings us together, it connects us all. 'Music is so powerful - that is what Tidal will be. A place for connection between artists and fans. The launch of the event in New York City brought together artists from across the musicial spectrum . The brains: Jay Z purchased Swedish tech company Aspiro for $56 million earlier this year to take control of Tidal and fellow streaming service WiMP; he has convinced his fellow stars to join him in the venture . Happy to be part of it: Kanye West could hardly contain his excitement at the launch of the new streaming service which aims to compete against the likes of Spotify and provide more money for the artists . 'The place to discover the music that will become the soundtrack for the rest of our lives.' The launch came after a huge social media push, in which the stars devoted their Twitter and Facebook pages to promoting Tidal. The mastermind behind the new system, Jay Z purchased Swedish tech company Aspiro for $56 million earlier this year to take control of Tidal. Before the purchase in February he reportedly hosted a meeting of the music world's biggest stars at which he lamented 'crass commercialization'. Daft Punk's two members were key figures in deciding on a strategy during the meeting days before the Grammy Awards at The Fig House event space in a remote part of Pasadena, Los Angeles. And it appears Jay Z's business mind convinced them to open their pockets, and sign on as 'co-owners'. Business men: Kanye West and Jay Z clap Alicia Keys after her passionate speech; the new system is subscription only and will cost users $20 a month, or $10 for a lower quality service . Everyone has signed up: From Madonna to Deadmau5, Kanye West, and JAY-Z, the scheme has attracted the cream of the music industry, with stars of country, pop and R & B all signing up .

        "input_text": "Vladimir Putin has appeared on television for the first time in a week amid health fears and suggestions that he is being subject to a coup, while rumours persist that his 31-year-old 'girlfriend' is about to give birth. Putin, 62, had cancelled several planned meetings during the week leading to speculation over his health and even claims that he was fighting to retain his position. Channel NTV showed footage of Putin meeting with supreme court president Vyacheslav Lebedev, which it claims was shot on Friday. Scroll down for video . Vladimir Putin, left, met with the supreme court president Vyacheslav Lebedev, right,  earlier today . According to Putin's staff, he was discussing judicial reform and the likely increase in the number of bankruptcies as as result of Russia's economic collapse. Putin is due to meet with the president of Kyrgyzstan in St Petersburg on Monday according to the Kremlin. The Russian president was last seen in public on March 5. For the past week, the Russian government has been reluctantly answering questions about Putin's health and suggestions that his unofficial girlfriend Alina Kabayeva had checked into a Swiss maternity clinic. Rumours about 31-year-old Alina Kabayeva surfaced with reports in Switzerland, Italy and Russia suggesting the gymnast had either given birth or was about to do so. It comes amid increased speculation over what has happened to Putin with the Russian leader not having been seen for a week. Alluring: Many Russians consider Alina Kabayeva the country's undeclared First Lady . The claims focused on an elite clinic in Lugano, in the Italian region of the neutral country, with some accounts saying she had a new daughter. Putin's spokesman - who has never confirmed a relationship between the 62 year old strongman and the Olympic gold-medal winner - insisted: 'Information about the birth of Vladimir Putin's child does not correspond to reality.' The Russian embassy in Kiev refused to comment on a report on the speculation in newspaper Blick. Russian Tatler yesterday repeated gossip that Kabayeva has two children already by Putin but adds there is no official confirmation. Kabayeva has been largely out of sight since quitting as an MP in Putin's United Russia party last September, when she took over as head of a major media conglomerate. Meanwhile, the Kremlin today issued a new picture showing Putin meeting the chairman of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev at his out-of-Moscow residence Novo-Ogaryovo. The image was meant to scotch suggestions that Putin was not at work amid speculation over a coup or illness. However, there were immediate claims the picture and TV footage was old, and that it was further evidence of his mystery absence. Current rumours in Moscow include Putin suffering a stroke, or an unfolding palace coup, following his sudden cancellation of a scheduled trip to Kazakhstan. With Moscow in febrile mood, a former senior aide to the strongman claimed another ex-KGB spy is being urgently lined up to take over from him. The theory suggests the Kremlin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov - a former defence minister - will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre Dmitry Medvedev. After this switch, dubbed a 'conspiracy of generals', Putin - currently the subject of swirling rumours over his health after not being seen in public for more than a week - would be swiftly ousted. Under the Russian constitution, in the event of a president leaving office, the prime minister replaces him in an acting role pending elections. This latest forecast of an imminent sea change in Russian politics came from Andrei Illarionov, Putin's former chief economics aide, who last year predicted Putin's land grab against Ukraine three weeks before it happened. While the Kremlin insists Putin is healthy and in full control of his government, Illarionov claimed: 'In the next few days we should expect the resignation of prime minister Dmitry Medvedev, and Sergei Ivanov being appointed in his place.' After this, 'the public is likely to be informed that the national leader (Putin) needs a well deserved rest'. Putin hands flowers to Olympic gold medal-winning gymnast Alina Kabayeva after awarding her with an Order of Friendship at an award ceremony in the Kremlin in 2001 . It has been claimed Russia's former defence minister Sergei Ivanov (pictured) will become prime minister in place of the lacklustre Dmitry Medvedev . Observers note that in recent days, Ivanov - who retained the military rank of colonel general and whose eldest son was killed in a mysterious drowning accident in Dubai last November - has been little seen in public. And Medvedev, who served as president for four years to 2012, is also out of the limelight. Some Kremlin-watchers say that Western sanctions have created huge tensions inside Putin's fractious entourage in recent weeks, with cash streams closed off. The murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov - branded a 'provocation' by Putin - has only intensified the infighting with blame for his slaying blamed on the president's close allies in Chechnya. Illarionov, a senior follow at the Cato Institute in Washington, earlier alleged a cover-up by the Russian authorities over Nemtsov's shooting yards from the Kremlin. Putin is said by his spokesman Dmitry Peskov to be 'exhaustively' working on documents but has - most unusually - not been seen publicly since 5 March, more than a week. Miss Kabayeva performs her routines during two events in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2000 (left) and 1999 (right). The former gymnast is rumoured to be the president's girlfriend . The Kremlin insists he is healthy, but this has done nothing to end speculation from Russians who for years were lied to over the health of geriatric Soviet leaders, and also Putin's predecessor Boris Yeltsin. 'Peskov's assertion that Putin is in good health, however, could also mean recent developments in Russian politics required Putin's presence in Moscow,' stated The Moscow Times today. 'A heightening of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and the murder of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, the investigation into whose death was reportedly accompanied by signs of an increased power struggle within the Russian administration, could have kept Putin busy behind closed doors.' In December, Putin brushed aside claims he could be overthrown. 'I can assure you that we don't have palaces, so a palace coup isn't really possible. The official presidential residence is the Kremlin. It is well protected,' he said. Ivanov, at 62 the same age as Putin, was a career KGB who studied English in Ealing during the Cold War. He is wooden in his public appearances and lacks Putin's common touch with ordinary Russians.",

        "input_text": "Fallen AFL star Ben Cousins has been taken into police custody for the third time in two weeks. He is currently in the emergency department of Armadale Hospital awaiting a mental health assessment and remains in a stable condition. Cousins was reportedly arrested after driving erratically and was caught breaking into a Sikh temple to compulsively take photos before climbing onto the roof of another home in Canning Vale in Perth's south, according to Fairfax Media. The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. Scroll down for video . Former West Coast Eagles captain Ben Cousins was assessed in the mental health ward at Perth's Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital after being caught on an SAS base in Western Australia on March 15 . The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple. 'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said. 'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.' Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police. 'He was not looking stable.' Before they arrived however, Cousins had moved onto another person's house and opened the door before realising Mr and Mrs. Singh were still watching him from their yard. He allegedly jumped fences and scaled a two-story home and paced along the roof. The police arrived ten minutes later and talked Cousins off the room before arresting him in Shreeve Road at 11am. CCTV has shown Cousins attempting to flee from police. 'I was pretty panicked - I locked the doors and we stayed inside in one of the bedrooms until I could get confirmation from police that it (the arrest) was done,' Witness Jenny Wilson told Network Ten. Ben Cousins, in 2007, after he was charged with drug possession and refusing a drug test . Cousins, who returned to the AFL with Richmond after the league banned him for one year, saw the latter stages of his career overshadowed by controversy . On March 16 Cousins, who has a history of serious drug abuse, was assessed at a mental health facility after he was caught behind the secure fences of an SAS base. The premiership star and former West Coast Eagles captain was apprehended at the Campbell Barracks near Perth at 11pm, according to Nine News. He was later assessed in the mental health ward at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital where he was reportedly being held under 'mental health watch'. The 36-year-old was moved out of the hospital on the afternoon of March 16 but doctors remain concerned about his mental health, Seven News reports. Cousins was arrested the week prior for allegedly driving erratically and not stopping when requested by police. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8. Cousins retired from the sport in 2010. He appeared in court in 2012 after being charged with drug possession . Cousins, 36, was arrested last week after allegedly being caught driving recklessly and failing to give a breath test. He is scheduled to face the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8 . The Brownlow Medalist's off-field antics have created headlines for almost a decade, due to well-publicised troubles with drugs and criminal connections. In 2005, Cousins and teammate Michael Gardiner became embroiled in police investigation into a nightclub shooting. The following year he was charged after abandoning his car and running away from police to avoid a booze bus. He entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007, being later being suspended by the AFL for bringing the game into disrepute. Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. In 2012, the then-retired star was charged with possession of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply by police located near a drug rehabilitation centre he was attending.

Mark Connolly, the second-in-command on President Barack Obama's security detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior supervisor in the Washington field office, reportedly drove a government car into the barricades after drinking at a late-night retirement party last week. Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback said recently appointed Director Joseph Clancy has been briefed on the March 4 incident and that Clancy has asked the Homeland Security Department's Inspector General's Office to investigate the incident. Officers on duty who witnessed the incident reportedly tried to arrest the agents and conduct a sobriety test, but a supervisor said to let the men go home. President Obama is aware of the incident and the investigation. Scroll down for video . An investigation has been launched to see if two Secret Service agents, including Mark Connolly (above), the second-in-command on President Obama's security detail, drove their car into a White House barricade . This after the men had reportedly been drinking at a late-night retirement party for Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan (above) The agency said the two agents have been reassigned to non-supervisory, non-operational jobs. The Washington Post reports that the men had been at a bar to celebrate the retirement of departing Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. Connolly and Ogilvie have declined to comment, though it is believed that the incident was likely caught on Secret Service video, which feeds to the agency's command center. According to witnesses, the two men had their flashing lights on and were showing their badges as they tried to get through a section of the grounds that had been closed as a suspicious package was being investigated at around 10:30pm. It was then that they struck the barricade, after also driving through some security tape. It is illegal to use the flashing lights on a government vehicle without a security reason, or to drive a vehicle after consuming any alcohol. In 2013 a civilian who crashed into a barricade at the White House was chased by police and shot and killed. 'The Secret Service is aware of the allegations of misconduct involving two of our employees at the White House complex,' said Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary, a spokesman for the Secret Service. 'If misconduct is identified, appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations.' Also commenting on the situation were House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and member Elijah Cummings of Maryland who said in a statement; 'The fact that this event involved senior-level agents is not only embarrassing but exhibits a clear lack of judgment in a potentially dangerous situation. 'The Committee as a whole remains committed to restoring the integrity of this elite agency and improving accountability at all staff levels.' The crash investigation is the latest embarrassment for the agency tasked with protecting the president. In the last six months, several top agency officials, including former Director Julian Pierson, have been forced out amid revelations of multiple, serious presidential security breaches. In September, a Texas man armed with a knife was able to climb a White House fence and run deep into the executive mansion before being apprehended. An internal investigation and an outside panel report both described serious problems within the agency. A four-member panel of former senior government officials concluded in a report released last year that the agency was too insular and starving for leadership. The panel recommended an agency outsider to replace Pierson, but Obama earlier this year tapped Clancy, a retired agent who led the agency on an interim basis after Pierson's ouster. January 2015: An employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency accidentally crashed a small drone on the South Lawn at the White House while operating it from a nearby apartment. The White House was put on lockdown for more than two hours after the crone hobbyist lost control of the device. October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs and arrested by the Secret Service. September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured. The shocking security breach launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation. Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn. August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates. May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House. November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for while being filmed by cameras for their reality show.",

        "input_text": "Friends of the Sierra Leone sprinter who 'absconded' in the UK for nine months after the Commonwealth Games have urged him to return home after he claimed asylum here. MailOnline spoke to Jimmy Thoronka's running mates in Freetown, Sierra Leone who said they wanted him back despite the tragedy that has apparently struck his life. Sandy Musa Aleu, Thoronka's coach at the amateur Freetown Flashpack Runners, said the athlete was the top hope for the sport in his country. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Jimmy Thoronka claims he did not want to return to Sierra Leone after he discovered his adoptive mother, Jelikatu Kargbo, above, had fallen victim to Ebola . Alone: Thoronka was arrested in London last Friday and faces deportation. He has claimed asylum saying there is no one in Sierra Leone to help him - and he wants to become a top athlete here . Taken by Ebola: Jelikatu Kargbo's grave seen from both sides in a cemetery for Ebola victims in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. Thoronka's adoptive mother is thought to have died from the disease  last year . Lost to a deadly disease: The graveyard where Kargbo was laid to rest. She tragically passed Ebola on to her three sisters and another son, Musa, who all perished from the fever which has ravaged parts of Sierra Leone . He said: 'I think he should come home and be a leader for athletics for our country. Maybe if he apologises to the UK for overstaying his visa, the British government can provide money for his sprinting expenses, his training and his accommodation at events.' Thoronka, 20, was arrested last Friday when he was found sleeping rough on the streets of London. He disappeared following last year's Glasgow games and failed to return to the Ebola-hit west African country. He claimed that his flight home was cancelled because of the Ebola crisis and his passport and wallet were stolen - then he was told that his family back home had been wiped out by the deadly virus. But a top Olympic official in Sierra Leone blasted Thoronka's claims yesterday that he was forced to stay after the Commonwealth Games and accused him of lying to claim asylum in Britain. Joseph Nyande, the secretary general of the National Olympic Committee, said: 'I spent a week in London and I still flew in. There was no problem with flights, even British Airways was running at that time. 'He absconded. We tried to get on to him, we tried to call him on the telephone. It was embarrassing for us.' He also cast doubt on Thoronka's claim that his real parents were killed in the 2002 civil war - before he was taken in by an adoptive mother who then died of Ebola. 'I know he has parents here. I don't think there is anything wrong with the parents,' he added. Officials in the country's capital Freetown told MailOnline that Jelikatu Kargbo, 56, the nurse in the police service who adopted Thoronka when he was five, along with four other children, after the civil war that ravaged the country, had indeed died last year. Talent: Jimmy, third from right, with fellow members of the Sierra Leone Police Athletics Club in Freetown . Popular: Jimmy Thoronka (left) with his coach Sandy Musa Aleu (front, centre) and other members of the Freetown Flashpack Runners. They want him to return . Hometown: Thoronka was raised by his adoptive mother Jelikatu Kargbo in Freetown, where she always encouraged his sprinting. This is the view over the Aberdeen Hill district of the capital city . Kargbo worked at the Kingdom Police Hospital in Freetown, where she caught Ebola from a patient, according to a police source. She was admitted to the Rugupta Hospital in the city last summer but not before she passed the virus on to her three sisters and another son, Musa - who all died. Sandy Musa Aleu said that Kargbo had brought him up as if he was her own child and encouraged his track and field work with the police athletics team. He said: 'She was a very kind woman who was always encouraging Jimmy in his sprinting. She came to the track with Musa and Jimmy every week to make sure they did their work.' The family lived in a shanty town area called Congo Cross, a teeming and inaccessible slum dominated by gangs and witchdoctors not far from Freetown's national stadium. Officials said it was not possible to determine if Thoronka's parents had lived or died in the fighting in the Sierra Leone bush during the country's civil war. Many families were torn apart as they fled the maurading militias. Thoronka had not tried to contact his family again. In recent interviews, Thoronka has expressed his gratitude to his adopted mother and said: 'This lady brought me into her home, she took me as a son and I took her as a mother.' Ibrahim Kabia, a fellow runner at Freetown Flashpack runners, said that Thoronka was adored by fans as the country's best 100m and 200m sprinter. He said: 'People would come to the pitch when he ran for the Sierra Leone Police Athletic Club. His fans shouted \"Jimmy!\" all the time when ran. 'He became a big star in our country in 2013 when he beat some Australian and Swedish guys in the championships. We were very proud of him.' Coach Aleu also revealed he last spoke with Thoronka during the competition in Glasgow last year and believes his friend is refusing to return home as he is still devastated because his adoptive mother died. Support: An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted more than 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete . Friends: Thoronka (far right) posing with other members of the Sierra Leone team before he 'absconded' after the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games . Fame: Thoronka carrying the Commonwealth baton in Sierra Leone. A top Olympic official called him an 'embarrassment' and cast doubt on his hard luck story on Wednesday . Success: Thoronka showed promise as a young athlete and is pictured here receiving the national schools U-17 100 metre gold medal. He said he wants to stay here to achieve his dream, otherwise 'he'd kill himself' He said: 'I tried to keep the news that his mother had died from him while he was in Glasgow but some of his friends had already told him. 'He called me and asked about his relatives. I said they were fine but he did not believe me. 'I wanted him to focus on the competition because he is first class. He had overcome so much and this was devastating for him. Now I am still worried about him.' Thoronka himself admitted he was confused after Mr Nyande publicaly undermined his story as another Olympic offiicial, Abdul Karim Sesay, spoke out in his defence and claimed Mr Nyande's attack was politically motivated. Thoronka told the Guardian: 'Two National Olympics Committee people are telling me two different things. 'If it can be proved that my adopted mother Jelikatu Kargbo is still alive and can continue to support me that will be very good. 'I would be very happy to speak with her again but I have been told that she is dead and I have no family left. 'If I go home, I will have no one to help me. If they can find my adopted mother and bring her to me, I will be very happy but I think some people are trying to destroy me.' Thoronka's friends hit back at Mr Nyande's statement and coach Aleu claimed that the association was trying to hide its own embarrassment at not providing the sprinter with the support he needed. He said: 'I had to nurse Jimmy myself when he had malaria last year. The Olympic association offered him nothing. He went to Glasgow fit and well because of me.' Thoronka was arrested on Friday and quizzed by officers over whether he was carrying or using drugs, which he denied. He has since been released. He is living in Home Office accommodation near Heathrow Airport and has been inundated with offers of help and requests for media interviews. He told the Guardian: 'I want to stay here. Nobody [would] look after me. No one persecuted me, my problem is I don’t have a family there. The person that would help me has passed [due to] Ebola. If I go back, I would not be able to make it, or I would kill myself because I would not proceed with my dream.' Asylum: Thoronka has been released by the Home Office and is living near Heathrow Airport for now . An online petition appealing to the authorities to let Thoronka remain in the UK has so far attracted nearly 70,000 signatures and well wishers have donated more than £28,000 to help the young athlete. Experts have said it would be safe for Thoronka to return to the country. Tom Dannatt, CEO of Street Child UK, the most active charity working with Ebola orphans across the region, said: 'Freetown is a safe area to travel to as long as people are properly educated about the risks and prevention methods to stop them contracting the virus. 'Education is the silver bullet to this crisis, which is why Street Child has trained over 1,200 Ebola educators in Sierra Leone to spread the word about Ebola prevention. 'If Jimmy washes his hands regularly using chlorine, avoids touching sick people and does not attend traditional funerals I have no doubt he will be safe. 'All Street Child staff across the country have been given this exact advice and not one of them has contracted the virus, even though they have been going into high risk areas to provide support for orphans in desperate need.'",

Their names have been handed to officers probing an alleged conspiracy of silence that protected senior figures for decades. The MPs are suspected of holding important details about the handling of previous criminal inquiries. Four MPs could be questioned by detectives investigating claims of an Establishment sex ring cover-up and Steve Rodhouse, Scotland Yard, said they will go ‘where the evidence takes us' Scotland Yard’s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse said officers will go ‘where the evidence takes us, without fear or favour’. He was speaking after the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed it is looking at Met corruption claims from the 1970s to 2005. As questions continued to emerge yesterday about whether other powerful men escaped justice, it was claimed that: . Allegations: It has been claimed that the late Cyril Smith was held and freed seven times over 30 years by police investigating claims he was a paedophile . Last week the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced it is investigating a raft of cover-up allegations against the Met. The 14 separate referrals, which span four decades, indicate the scale of the task police face in getting to the bottom of historic child abuse cases. The allegations include suppressing evidence, hindering or halting investigations and covering up offences because of the involvement of MPs and police officers. Documents seen by the Daily Mail indicate that up to four serving MPs could be questioned as part of their work. None of the public figures has previously been named publicly in connection with the scandal. It is understood that victims believe they could hold highly sensitive information about their abusers which could help further their inquiries. It was also claimed yesterday that a member of the Queen’s family and an MP were identified as part of a major child abuse inquiry. But the Sunday Mirror claimed the operation was shut down by the Crown Prosecution Service for national security reasons. One former Met officer told the newspaper: ‘I was in a car with two other vice squad officers. They were discussing a madam who had provided a girl of about 15 to Oliver Reed. ‘The detective sergeant said he had just had a major child abuse investigation shut down by the CPS regarding a royal and an MP. ‘He did not mention names, but he said the CPS had said it was not in the public’s interest because it ‘could destabilise national security’.’ Separately, further inquiries are being carried out into whether detectives were told to limit a child abuse investigation centred on the former MP Lord Janner. A home belonging to the 86-year-old peer, who was a Labour MP in Leicester for 27 years, was searched in 2013. Last year it was reported that in 1989 a detective sergeant had been told not to arrest Janner or search his home. Earlier this month Home Secretary Theresa May appointed Justice Lowell Goddard to head a public inquiry into historic child sex abuse. The senior New Zealand judge will investigate whether public bodies and other institutions have ‘taken seriously their duty of care to protect children’. The reformed independent inquiry into child abuse will be able to ‘compel witnesses’ in a bid to get to the bottom of many difficult and complex claims. On Saturday, the Daily Mail revealed how Met deputy commissioner Albert Laugharne claimed he was part of one cover-up. He said that, while head of Lancashire police, he was asked to lie about allegations involving Smith, later unmasked as a paedophile. Sarah Green, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said: ‘I would like to reassure people our investigations will be thorough and robust.’",

Their appearances come a week after the 55-year-old was shot four times in the back while walking along a bridge in full view of the Kremlin with his model girlfriend Anna Duritskaya, 23. One of the suspects - Zaur Dadayev - has allegedly made a statement confirming his guilt, Judge Nataliya Mushnikova said. She did not specify his actions. All of the men were escorted from a bus to Basmanny district court, in Moscow, with their hands bound in front of them and masked men standing either side. Scroll down for video . Five suspects including a policeman who served in Chechnya have appeared in a Moscow court over the assassination of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov. One of the suspects, Tamerlan Eskerkhanov, is pictured above . Another suspect is Zaur Dadayev, who is believed to have served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. Judge Nataliya Mushnikova said he has now made a statement confirming his involvement . Once inside they continued to be flanked by armed guards and were forced to speak from a defendant's cage. The Investigative Committee, the state agency leading the investigation, applied to the court to formally arrest the suspects. All five will now remain in custody. Meanwhile a sixth man thought to be involved in Mr Nemtsov's death blew himself up  after being approached by police at his apartment block, Interfax said. The 30-year-old reportedly threw a grenade at officers in Grozny, Chechnya, on Saturday night before setting one off near himself. The court heard that Dadayev, 33, served for around ten years in the 'Sever' battalion, which is part of the interior ministry of Chechnya. His sister confirmed that he had won medals for bravery and courage. Judge Mushnikova added: 'Dadayev’s involvement in committing this crime is confirmed by, apart from his own confession, the totality of evidence gathered as part of this criminal case.' Anzor Gubashev, who worked for a private security company in Moscow, was named as another suspect. He denied any involvement. Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's federal security service, said Dadayev and Gubashev were 'suspected of carrying out the crime'. It was not clear if either of the men were believed to have fired the shots that killed Mr Nemtsov. Nemtsov (left) and his 23-year-old model girlfriend, Anna Duritskaya (right), were walking through Moscow when he was shot four times in the back . The masked men who escorted the suspects up a set of stairs carried large guns and kept completely covered in dark clothing . Russian state investigators said they are seeking the arrest of five suspects, who appeared in court earlier today . Even when they were inside the building the suspects were kept bent over and well within the grasps of the armed guards . Four guards escort Dadayev, one of the main suspects, to and from the courtroom. They carry several guns between them as well as radios . Dadayev, 33, was forced to speak from inside a defendants' cage during the hearing at the district court . Anzor Gubashev is escorted by a policeman and uses a woolly grey hat to cover his face. State news agencies reported that Gubashev worked for a private security company in Moscow . Three unidentified suspects hide their faces using their jackets and jumpers while waiting behind bars in the courtroom . Aaimani Dadayeva, mother of Dadayev, said she was stunned at the arrest of her son. 'I was informed today that my son has been detained on suspicion of involvement in Boris Nemtsov's murder,' she told Interfax late on Saturday. 'I can't believe it. He could not have committed this crime.' Reports suggest the other suspects include Gubashev's younger brother Shagid and two men - Tamerlan Eskerkhanov and Khamzat Bakhayev. Mr Bortnikov added that the developments had been reported to the president, but he stressed they were continuing 'necessary operative and investigative work' on the case. One suspect, whose face could not be seen, was escorted into the court building by two masked guards who held on to his collar . Another suspect pulled the hood of his grey jacket over his face and had his hands bound in front of him . Russian police guard the yard of Basmanny district court, in Moscow, where the suspects in the killing of Mr Nemtsov were delivered . Russian policemen guard the yard of the court after the suspects arrived via bus and were taken inside . At the time of his death Mr Nemtsov had been working on a report about Russian military involvement in the eastern Ukraine conflict. He was also in the midst of organising a march against the war and had written a number of reports in recent years linking Putin and other politicians to alleged corruption. The shooting occurred a few hours after he had made a radio appearance denouncing Putin for 'mad, aggressive' policies in Ukraine. Surveillance footage apparently showed a man climbing into a white getaway car and being driven away. Russian officials have denied any involvement, with President Vladimir Putin dubbing the murder a 'provocation'. In a speech with officials from the interior ministry, Putin said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext. Russian President Vladimir Putin attends an annual expanded meeting of the Interior Ministry's Board on March 4. He said: 'The most serious attention should be paid to high-profile crimes, including the ones with a political subtext' The body of Mr Nemtsov lies in a body bag in central Moscow in the hours after he was gunned down. He had been organising a march in opposition to the Ukraine conflict at the time of his death . 'Russia should be devoid at last of the kind of shame and tragedies that we have recently endured and seen. 'I mean the murder, the audacious murder of Boris Nemtsov right in the centre of the capital.' He added that he would do all he could to ensure the killers were brought to justice, but has made no comment on the detentions. Russia's top investigative body said it was looking into several possible motives, including that Mr Nemtsov was killed in an attempt to smear Putin's image. It said it was also examining possible connections to Islamic extremism and Mr Nemtsov's personal life. Mourners follow the open-coffin of Mr Nemtsov during a farewell ceremony at the Sakharov centre on Tuesday . Hundreds of floral tributes including bunches of red roses were left on the grave of the murdered Russian opposition leader  after a burial ceremony . A woman weeps as she looks looks towards the coffin of Mr Nemtsov during the farewell ceremony . But Mr Nemtsov's associates said they will only be satisfied if prosecutors track down whoever orchestrated the killing, and not just the people who pulled the trigger. Ilya Yashin, one of Mr Nemtsov's closest allies, said: 'It's extremely important that the matter not be limited to detention of the shooters, whether these are the real killers or not. 'The key task is the identification and detention of who ordered the attack.' Thousands of Russians paid their final respects to Mr Nemtsov when he was laid to rest in the capital earlier this week. The politician's mother Dina, 87, and four children led the mourners with ex-UK prime minister Sir John Major also attending.",

However, researchers have discovered a rural community in Brazil that still follows the natural sleep cycles of the past  - despite having access to the same technology as its urban neighbours. And they now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health. Researchers have discovered a rural community in Brazil that follows the 'natural sleep cycles' (stock image) of our ancestors who rose with the sun, and typically went to bed when it set. The experts now plan to study this group to learn more about how our move away from the natural rhythm could be damaging our health . The community was discovered in the small town of Baependi in south-eastern Brazil in the state of Minais Gerais. Researchers from the University of Surrey and the University of São Paulo studied the population and asked them questions about their sleep habits and patterns. 'In big cities, the availability of cheap electricity has brought us both artificial lighting and a multitude of other electronic devices that compete with us going to sleep at night,' said lead author Dr Malcolm von Schantz from the University of Surrey. 'As a result, most of us go to bed much later than our ancestors did, and, many of us are sleeping less. 'Even though the people in Baependi have access to electricity and television, their daily rhythms are much closer to those of previous generations. 'Studying this population is like being able to look back at past generations through a pair of binoculars and provide an insight into the benefit this natural pattern may be having on their health.' Historian Roger Ekirch of Virginia Tech recently revealed an 'overwhelming amount of historical evidence' that suggested we used to sleep in stages. He found more than 500 references about ancestors sleeping in two shorter periods throughout the night. The total sleep would occur in a 12-hour period that began with up to four hours sleep, an 'awake period' of four hours and then ended with a second four-hour sleep. These days it is widely accepted human sleep patterns are governed by the 'circadian rhythm'. This is the 24-hour cycle of being awake and then, when it becomes dark, resting. 'However, built into this 24-hour pattern is a series of shorter cycles of about 90 minutes - called the \"ultradian rhythm\",' added Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, author of Tired But Wired: How To Overcome Your Sleep Problems. This explains smaller peaks and troughs of energy throughout the day. Dr Ramlakhan believes this ultradian rhythm is a throwback to our hunter-gatherer years. And while we tend to pay much more attention to the 24-hour cycle than the 90-minute one, Dr Ramlakhan believes the body works best when we move with these natural ultradian rhythms, building in pauses, stopping and resting, so continually renewing our energy. The community was discovered in Baependi (marked) in south-eastern Brazil. Residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed, and the average answers from the town dwellers were 07.15am and 22.20pm. Whereas people in the countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20pm . In particular, the residents were asked when they would prefer to wake up and go to bed if they were completely free to plan their day. The average answers from town residents were 07.15 and 22.20, whereas people in the surrounding countryside preferred to rise at 06.30am and go to bed at 21.20. The researchers believe  the difference is due to town residents following much less of a natural sleep/wake cycle because of the influence of artificial lighting. 'When we asked the same question in London, the average answers were 08.30am and 23.15pm,' continued Dr von Schantz. The paper explained that people in Baependi maintain a stronger link with the so-called solar rhythm because they predominantly work outdoors. They therefore have similar patterns as pre-industrial ancestors.  Town residents follow less of a natural sleep/wake cycle because of the influence of artificial lighting (stock image) The paper explained that the people of Baependi, especially those in the countryside, maintain a much stronger link with the so-called solar rhythm. This is because they predominantly work outdoors and therefore have similar patterns as our pre-industrial ancestors. Solar time uses the mid-points of the light and dark 'periods' - notably midnight and noon - as timing references. In circadian rhythms, sunrise start this clock on its 24-hour run, but this continues regardless of a shift in when the sun sets meaning the mid-points vary. 'Midnight really represents the middle of the dark phase, and yet many of us in the industrialised world are not even in bed by then,' continued Dr von Schantz. 'Our colleagues at the University of São Paulo have studied this population, so there is a lot of data emerging about the health outcomes of the same population. 'We are optimistic that this project will teach us to what extent cardiovascular health, obesity, diabetes, and mental health problems may be associated with our move away from the natural day/night cycle, and the associated sleep loss.'",

'Somehow, it just didn’t feel like this was the right time for us to step forward,' Romney told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric during an interview that was released on Thursday. 'I would love to be president. I just concluded I was not the best person to carry forward the Republican torch.' Romney wouldn't endorse one of the many possible GOP presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Katie Couric Interviews Mitt Romney in San Diego, California, at his son's home. 'I would love to be president. I just concluded I was not the best person to carry forward the Republican torch,' Romney told her . Romney wouldn't endorse one of the many possible GOP presidential candidates in his first interview since he took his name off the 2016 roster but spoke sharply of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton . Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul would all make tremendous presidents, he indicated. Bush, who was widely considered Romney's biggest hurdle toward securing the Republican presidential nomination for a second consecutive time due to their similarity in background and policy positions, Romney described as a 'sound, effective governor.' He will make for 'a very formidable and capable candidate,' said Romney, who met privately with the fellow former governor just before he definitively ended rumors that he was contemplating a 2016 bid. Walker he characterized as 'a man of integrity and character' and said 'he makes a very compelling case to become a nominee.' 'He was one that faced a recall, fought for his agenda; it was supported by the people of Wisconsin,' Romney told Couric. 'I think a guy like that really has stood the test of a very close inspection.' Romney also voiced approval of a possible Rubio candidacy,saying the freshman senator 'has really distinguished himself' on foreign policy. And while he and Paul, whose father Ron competed against the Massachusetts governor for the party's blessing in both 2008 and 2012, don't often see eye to eye, particularly on foreign policy issues, Romney said he understands the draw to the non-traditional Republican lawmaker. 'A lotta young people are very excited about Rand Paul. And of course, there’s a libertarian strain in my party, and he’s connected with a lotta folks who wanna see us take a different course as a party,' Romney said. 'I mean, more power to him as he expresses his views.' Clinton, on the other hand, is in quite 'a mess' over her secret server and will have to defend what he called 'the Hillary Clinton/Barack Obama foreign policy.' 'I mean, it’s always something with the Clintons,' he said, responding to a question about the former secretary of state's email debacle. 'They have rules which they describe before they get into something, and then they decide they don’t have to follow their own rules. And that, I think, is gonna be a real problem for her,' he said. He added, 'She didn’t follow the rules and regulations of the federal government.' The former Massachusetts governor said he passed on a third presidential campaign because 'it just didn't feel right' and would instead allocate his time to business and philanthropic causes, as well as his wife Ann, pictured here during the interview, and their 23 grandchildren . 'Somehow, it just didn’t feel like this was the right time for us to step forward,' Romney told Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric during their interview on Wednesday, which was released Thursday . Romney became the laughing stock of much of the political class in the lead up to the 2012 election when he named Russia as the United States' greatest geopolitical foe but has since been heralded by Republicans as as visionary. In the interview he again scrutinized Clinton for her infamous 'reset' with Russia and the mock button she gave the country's top diplomat Sergei Lavrov in 2009. He also warned that Islamic extremists abroad are unlikely to suffer defeat if the Obama administration continues to refuse to put American troops on the ground. 'I’m afraid you’re gonna have to see more American military involvement in order to keep ISIS from spreading even further,' he said. It would be ideal for most of the ground troops to be provided by regional partners such as 'Turkey or Saudi Arabia or others,' Romney said. 'But I think, as the President of the United States, you have to say that we will defeat ISIS, period. Full stop. And we will do what’s necessary for that to happen.' Reacting to former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod's claims in his memoir that Romney suggested in his election night, congratulatory call to the president that he won reelection because blacks in urban cities voted for him, Romney said a 'misunderstanding' must have occurred. Axelrod claims that Romney told Obama, 'You really did a great job of getting the vote out in places like Cleveland and Milwaukee.' 'I certainly did not,' Romney told Couric. 'I remember going into the room with a few of my staff people, picking up the phone and being as gracious as I could possibly be at a very difficult time, and congratulating the president on winning and congratulating him on having a good campaign and running a good campaign. The former Republican politician acknowledged that he 'may well have said what a good job they did turning people out, because they did.' But 'I don’t even know what happened in Milwaukee, so some of those quotes are obviously a misunderstanding.' 'I had nothing but congratulations for the president and positive feelings that I expressed to him,' he posited.",

Aspiring lawyer Aleysha McLoughlin, 16, had been living with her foster mother Beverley Sharples in Bolton and was found hanged. Just 24 hours before the teenager, who had a history of self harming, had been taken to A&E at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester where a medic told her she was 'having a bad day.' After her death scars were found on Aleysha's arms and thighs, which may have been many years old, and spelled out the words 'hate', 'fat' and 'ruin', Bolton Coroners' Court heard. An inquest into the GCSE student's death heard she had been taken from her parents due to their drug addiction and initially lived with her great-aunt. She flourished at school where she was tipped for straight A grades at GCSE and competed for head girl status. But when she was 14 her sister Karly got in touch through Facebook and said she wanted to meet. The pair did so and as they grew closer and began having contact with their biological mother Gaynor Rothwell. At one stage she disappeared for three and the teenager's behaviour deteriorated. She was later moved into foster care in November 2012. From March 2013 Aleysha began running away from home for days at a time and would often be found with her 19-year-old sister. The two even staged a 'rooftop protest' on a care centre at one point in a bid to be housed closer together. The inquest heard that there had been numerous attempts by social workers to help the teenager, and her foster mother Beverley Sharples had taken her to hospital after she took an overdose. But Aleysha refused help. Mrs Sharples added that on February 8 last year after enjoying a 'normal family night in' with a takeaway, Aleysha had gone to meet her sister. But shortly after the pair leaving she received a phone call from the police saying the pair had been caught trying to jump off a nearby bridge but were stopped before they had the chance. On April 2 last year Mrs Sharples received a call from St Catherine's Academy in Bolton saying the teenager had been self harming, and she took her to Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester. Mrs Sharples told the inquest: 'I phoned the paramedics and they suggested we go. She wasn't happy about going. She was assessed in A&E then sent to another bit of the hospital and the nurse also asked if she wanted to speak to someone while she was there. The teenager had been taken into care after she began getting into trouble with her sister . 'Surprisingly she said yes which is a massive step because she had refused up until then. A man from the RAID team took her to a room and she was in there for one hour and ten minutes and I wasn't allowed in. 'He said she wouldn't engage. She said it was a waste of time and he said 'I was having a bad day'. 'Before she went to sleep she was really upset. I asked what she was crying for and she said 'I'm sorry, you have been in the hospital with me for five-and-a-half hours, I'm a pain in the bum.' I said yes but you're my pain in the bum.' The medic was thought to have been unaware of Aleysha's scars at this stage. The next morning, Aleysha came downstairs at 10am, but did not want any breakfast. Mrs Sharples asked if she wanted to go with her to Horwich but instead Aleysha went back to bed. Aleysha's foster mother had taken her to Royal Bolton Hospital after she self harmed and a medic told the teenager that she was 'having a bad day.' The next day Aleysha, 16, was found hanged in her bedroom . Aleysha  lived with her great aunt for years after being taken from her parents because of their drug addiction . The foster mother said Aleysha had fitted in well at their home and the two had been getting close. Mrs Sharples left the house and returned at around 2pm after running some errands. When she went upstairs to check on Aleysha some time later she found her body. Pathologist Dr Charles Wilson told the inquest that there were scars on the teenager's arms and thighs, and some spelled out words. He said: 'On her left thigh were the words ruin and fat. The cuts would have taken at least a couple of months to reach the stage I saw. They could have been years old. 'A wound to her upper arm spelled the word hate.' Ms Sharples said foster children were always told to cover their bodies when in their foster homes in accordance with safeguarding rules, and so she didn’t notice any signs of self-harming. Flowers and tributes were left to Aleysha after she was found hanged in her bedroom on April 3 . Bolton Coroners' Court heard that the teenager had repeatedly refused to engage with social workers . The teenager's great aunt Carol Kerfoot had cared for her from July 2003 until she was 14. She told the hearing she first saw some surface scratches on Aleysha's arms in November 2012 after she returned to the house from a short stint in foster care. 'They were surface scratches but when I talked about it she ran off upstairs and didn't want to discuss it,' she said. 'It was the only time I noticed self-harm. 'I found her to be a good child. She had some issues and sadly they led to the breakdown of our placement but she was a good child. She had a lot of friends and was beautiful inside and out. 'She always maintained she didn't want anything to do with her real parents but then she did. Her sister got in touch over Facebook and it snowballed from there.'

Ambra Battilana, 22, went to the NYPD on Friday to allege that Weinstein, 63, had groped her breasts during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca offices in Manhattan, grabbed her thigh and tried to kiss her. Battilana 'knows that Harvey has money and power and that he's going to come after her,' a source told the New York Daily News. 'But she's confident. ...She's not afraid of Harvey.' Scroll down for more . Ambra Battilana, the Italian model who has accused Harvey Weinstein of groping her has told friends she is 'not afraid' of the movie producer despite his fearsome reputation . Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, (left) has accused Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein, 63, (pictured right leaving his home on Tuesday) of touching her breasts and thigh in Manhattan on Friday evening . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with the father-of-five who has produced hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York . 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. 'She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein is alleged to have asked Battilana if her breasts were real before he groped her chest and asked for a kiss. The distraught model allegedly asked him to stop and then promptly left. Surveillance footage from outside the Tribeca office is being analyzed, according to police sources. Weinstein was reportedly interviewed by the NYPD Special Victims Squad on Saturday after going to the police precinct voluntarily. The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with father-of-five Weinstein . Italian newspapers in 2012 reported that Ambra Battilana (pictured) had made a rape complaint against a 70-year-old car dealer ex-boyfriend when she was under 18. The case was dismissed after she never showed up to talk to prosecutors about the allegations . No charges have been filed and he has promised full cooperation with the probe. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past citing her involvement in Silvio Berlusconi's 'bunga-bunga' orgies in 2010 and reports in the Italian press that she had previously alleged to police that her 70-year-old boyfriend had raped her. Ambra Battilana's police statement, made in the Alba region of Italy in December 2010, was published in an Italian newspaper, where she said she was 'forced against my will' into having sex with the 'businessman of substantial means' for money when she was under 18. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable verify her claims. Miss Battilana met the wealthy, car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. The age of sexual consent is 14 in Italy but it is illegal to pay for sex or to have sex with a prostitute who is under the age of 18. The Italian newspaper, Il Giornale, quoted from her 2010 police statement, where she recalled meeting the businessman at an organized dinner. The statement read: 'He invited me to ride in his car. Upset by the invitation because of my inexperience and very young age, he induced me to accept out of politeness. Sources close to Harvey Weinstein told The New York Post's Page Six on Monday that the 22-year-old model's allegations were an attempt at 'blackmail' 'To my enormous embarrassment he began to ask me questions about my sexual preferences and to tell me about his erotic fantasies. 'Then as he started to caress my hand and left leg, he proposed that I become his 'playmate' and before I could oppose he gave me a bag with €2,000. He assured me that it was only an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month.' She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money. 'From that time on he began to demand sexual relations in compensation for the cash which happened once a week. I did not have the strength to get out of the vicious circle.' According to reports in Il Giornale, Miss Battilana's statement continued that a few days later 'the businessman took me to an apartment in his possession... under his domination, I went in'. She told the police that the businessman began 'to violate my every wish'. Afterwards, she received €2,000. Ten days later, the same thing happened and she received another €2,000 and the relationship continued in this manner. She said: 'With the money received I helped my mother and bought designer clothes, bags, shoes, furs, jewelry and more.' The former beauty queen has an international modeling career, shooting editorial campaigns in Europe and the U.S. for designers and magazines . Battilana allegedly previously witnessed a 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian premier Berlusconi (pictured) and offered testimony to Italian authorities . At Christmas, the 70-year-old spent €5000 on her at a large clothing store. 'I continued to feel uncomfortable about the situation', she said. But she got an apartment in the city center in which everything was paid for with the businessman's money, Il Giornale claimed. She said in her statement that she suffered the 'commodification of my person' and became 'aware of being used by a man who treated me like a prostitute'. The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Il Giornale newspaper is owned by the Berlusconi family. Miss Battilana gave statements to Italian authorities about disgraced Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi's 'bunga-bunga' orgies in 2010 to which she was invited as a Miss Italia contestant and aspiring model. Ambra's lawyer Patrizia Bugnano, a senator, started proceedings against Berlusconi in October last year for defamation after the ex-politician said that she 'brainwashed' or 'manipulated' the two girls. Miss Battilana also said never had sex for money during a 2012 court trial involving Berlusconi's sex parties. She has sued for damages over her image but it is unclear whether she has been awarded a financial sum. Italian newspapers in 2012 reported that Ambra Battilana had made a rape complaint against a 70-year-old car dealer, ex-boyfriend when she was under 18. The case was dismissed after she never showed up to talk to prosecutors about the allegations . Harvey Weinstein seen with a smile on his face as he enters his office building in New York City on Tuesday. The movie producer has been accused of groping a 22-year-old woman last Friday . After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, she began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. The 22-year-old recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie and has been used as a model by a number of different photographers including Marcello Cassano and Kat Irlin. Photographer Marcello Cassano, who previously dated Miss Battilana, told Daily Mail Online on Tuesday: 'Ambra has a magnetic beauty and a strong personality oriented mainly in success.' He added: 'She comes from a poor and not traditional family.' The former boyfriend also alleged that since the model was a minor, she has had problems in court, first over being paid by an older boyfriend and then in relation to Berlusconi. Of their relationship, Mr Cassano said: 'We were together for a year, breaking up at the end of Berlusconi's trial when she was claiming to receive a big amount of money as compensation. 'At that time I was hoping that she was able to change but I'm glad we broke up.' She established a new Twitter account on Monday and posted the message: 'Don't stop Dreaming just because you had a Nightmare.'

Right, she is pictured leaving a Milan court with her lawyer in July 2013 . Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . The Manhattan District Attorney has yet to decide whether charges will be filed against Weinstein. Sex crimes detectives reportedly spoke with Miss Battilana on Monday. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 25 years his junior, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also have three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton which ended in 2004.

        "input_text": "A group of 47 Republican senators warned Iran's mullahs on Monday that any agreement the Obama administration strikes with the Islamic republic to limit Tehran's nuclear program may be short-lived unless Congress formally approves it. In a rare open letter to Iranian leaders, Arkansas freshman Sen. Tom Cotton and 46 others from the GOP wrote that without congressional approval, 'we will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more than an executive agreement between President Obama and Ayatollah Khamenei.' 'The next president could revoke such an executive agreement with the stroke of a pen,' the Republicans wrote, 'and future Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any time.' The White House in turn tried to brand Republicans as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a 'partisan strategy to undermine the president' while demanding power that goes against the role the Founding Fathers envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE LETTER . Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, shown in January at the US Capitol, organized 47 Republican senators to warn Iran that a nuclear agreement could be short-lived unless Congress approves it . The White House in turn tried to brand Republicans as warmongers and accused them of pursuing a 'partisan strategy to undermine the president' while demanding authority that goes against the role the Founding Fathers envisioned the legislative branch playing in foreign affairs . Secretary of State John Kerry (third from left) met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif (third from right) for a new round of nuclear negotiations last wek while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington telling Congress that Tehran can't be trusted . 'The rush to war, or at least the to the military option that many Republicans are advocating is not at all in the best interest of the United States,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday afternoon. Earnest speculated that letter emanated from Senate Republicans' concern that as soon as a deal is signed, the White House would begin pressuring Congress to begin lifting sanctions. The White House would first want to see 'demonstrated compliance' on the part of Iran before that would ever happen, the president's spokesman said. 'The president does not envision substantial sanctions relief for Iran right at the negotiating table.' It will not even be weeks or months before such a conversation would take place, he explained. 'I'm talking about years.' The single-page letter at no point makes reference to sanctions - or war, for that matter. Republicans and Democrats alike have said they would like to see a stricter sanctions regime enforced if Iran does not agree to the United States' terms by the end of the month, and a resolution to that effect is set to come to the floor of the Senate. That legislation would not authorize the president to go to war with Iran, though . Still, Earnest contended that letter signers have no alternative to President Barack Obama's diplomatic strategy other than 'a military option.' 'If they want to mask it as part of some sort of civics lesson that they want to share with Iran's political leadership, they're welcome to do that,' he said. 'It might evince some reluctance or at least hesitations about the wisdom of their strategy, or at least the wisdom of their ultimate goal here,' he charged. He added: 'The efforts of neoconservatives in the previous administration to do that frankly hurt the country's standing around the world.' Speaking to reporters after a meeting in the Oval Office with European Council President Donald Tusk, Obama commented that it's 'somewhat ironic' that Republicans want to align themselves with 'hardliners' in Iran. 'It's an unusual coalition,' he said. ON NOTICE: The letter to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (pictured) warns that senators who signed it will be in office long after President Barack Obama leaves the White House . Later in the briefing he brought up an Authorization for the Use of Military Force agreement the White House sent to Congress last month asking for the power to fight ISIS with ground troops in special circumstances. Some Republicans complained that the legislative language would bind the president too tightly because it strictly prohibited an 'enduring' deployment of US forces. 'We see a Republican Party that is eager to.... direct almost unlimited authority to the President of the United States to wage war, but to try to repeatedly tie his hands when he is trying to conduct diplomacy,' Earnest claimed. The President would rather use America's influence to try to build coalitions around the world, not only because he thinks it is 'more effective,' Earnest said, but because it 'has yielded important results for the American people.' He cited the global coalition to destroy ISIS as an example. 'There is a starkly different approach between the one that is advocated by Republicans that puts the military option and war-fighting at the top of the list,' he continued. 'That is not an approach that the vast majority of the American public support, and it's certainly not an approach that our recent history indicates is the best way to protect American national security interests.' The U.S. and other nations are seeking a pact that would let Western powers verify that Iran will not obtain a nuclear weapon. Although the letter, first reported by Bloomberg, is addressed to 'Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran,' it's equally aimed at delivering a message to Obama. 'The president may serve only two 4-year terms, whereas senators may serve an unlimited number of 6-year terms,' Cotton's group wrote. 'As applied today, for instance, President Obama will leave office in January 2017, while most of us will remain in office well beyond then – perhaps decades.' Cotton told Bloomberg that 'Iran's ayatollahs need to know before agreeing to any nuclear deal that … any unilateral executive agreement is one they accept at their own peril.' California Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Monday after that she was 'appalled' at the Republican effort to 'blow up a major effort by our country and the world powers to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the Iranian nuclear program.' 'This is a highly inappropriate and unprecedented incursion into the president’s prerogative to conduct foreign affairs,' she said. 'This letter only serves one purpose—to destroy an ongoing negotiation to reach a diplomatic agreement in its closing days.' The White House said Monday that the Republican senators's move 'certainly interferes' with ongoing negotiations. Their effort to 'essentially throw sand in the gears here is not helpful,' Earnest said, and is not 'the role our Founding Fathers envisioned Congress for to play when it comes to foreign affairs.' He told reporters the letter raises 'legitimate' questions about the 'intent' of Republican lawmakers. In remarks on the Senate floor Monday afternoon top-ranking Democrat Harry Reid said the judgment of the chamber's Republicans 'seems to be clouded by their abhorrence of President Obama.' Reid, who was the Senate's majority leader until January, when Republicans rose to power, said the letter signers were 'undermining' Obama 'while empowering the Ayatollahs.' 'It is unprecedented for one political party to directly intervene in an international negotiation, with the sole goal of embarrassing the President,' he stated. 'We as leaders should do everything we can to ensure these negotiations have a chance to succeed. When it comes to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb, we should put partisanship aside.' Reid said that most Senate Democrats disagreed with President George W. Bush’s foreign policy, but they never even 'considered' sending a letter to Saddam Hussein because 'it would have been an embarrassment.' 'Obviously Republicans don’t know how to do anything other than attempt these seemingly juvenile political attacks against the President,' he said, attacking his successor, Mitch McConnell's ability to govern. The uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, Iran is a major sticking point with the US, which wants inspectors to have unfettered access to the Iranian regime's nuclear program . 'The greatest threat against the world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons,' Israeli Priime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Congress last Tuesday . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint meeting of Congress last week in Washington. 'The greatest threat against the world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons,' he warned lawmakers. Republicans and some Democrats want Congress to have a vote on any agreement. The pact the bargainers are working on does not actually require congressional approval, however, because it is not a treaty, which would require a two-thirds majority Senate vote to be ratified. Last week Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, postponed action on legislation that would give Congress a vote on any deal that emerges. He delayed the measure in the face of solid Democratic opposition to moving ahead on the bill now, just weeks before an end-of-March deadline for negotiators to produce an outline of an agreement. On CBS' 'Face the Nation' Sunday, McConnell said the president would need congressional approval to lift sanctions already imposed on Tehran because of its nuclear program. 'I think he cannot work around Congress forever,' McConnell said. Obama said in a separate CBS interview that the U.S. would 'walk away' from the talks unless they produce a procedure for verifying that restrictions on Iran's nuclear effort are working. The letter released Monday was signed by 47 of the Senate's 54 Republicans. Included were McConnell and the rest of the Senate GOP plus presidential contenders Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas. The next negotiations are scheduled for March 15, and wide gaps remain between the two sides. Iran has said its nuclear program is peaceful and is aimed at producing energy. The Associated Press found no discussion of the letter in Iranian media, and Iran's regime had no immediate response to it. Cotton serves on the Senate's Armed Service and Intelligence committees. He said Monday morning on the Fox News Channel that Iran is a bigger threat to the U.S. than the ISIS terror army operating in Iraq and Syria. He also said he would like to see some Democrats sign on to his letter. 'I'd encourage Hillary Clinton to join us,' he said. Tom Cotton Open Letter to Iran uploaded by DailyMail.com .",

        "input_text": "A former soldier who claimed to have fought off a Vietnamese gang, like karate super-hero Bruce Lee, has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder after a judge ruled that his tales were 'totally incredulous'. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal were told of the night Norman Olsen had been at a bar in Hong Kong, when he became involved in a fight with a gang of 12 armed with weapons in the 1970s. The Queenslander said he was able to take on each of the 'crazed lunatics... screaming and yelling' at him as they came with batons that had spiked two-inch balls attached to the ends. He detailed how he was able to escape with an injury to his elbow. Mr Olsen argued that such events left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and took the matter to the AAT for an appeal after it was initially rejected. Norman Olsen, a former soldier, who claimed to have fought off a dozen attackers like karate super-hero Bruce Lee (pictured) has failed to win his claim for post-traumatic stress disorder, after a judge ruled that his tales were 'totally incredulous' 'In relation to the Hong Kong Bar incident, The account Mr Olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee (pictured) movie, Mr Olsen playing the role of the super hero,' tribunal member Marella Denovan said on March 4 . Tribunal member Marella Denovan was not reasonably satisfied  and consequently knocked back with Mr Olsen's claims on March 4. 'In relation to the Hong Kong Bar incident, the account Mr Olsen gave conjured up images of a scene out of a Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee movie, Mr Olsen playing the role of the super hero,' Dr Denovan said. 'It is totally incredulous.' A number of psychiatrists gave evidence, as Dr Denovan concluded Dr Bradley Ng's to be the most reliable. Dr Ng questioned the legitimacy of the accounts of events provided by Mr Olsen, saying that the former soldier talks quite boastfully about punching and assaulting people while claiming to have been in fear in Vietnam. Dr Ng further opined that there is a high chance that Mr Olsen has an antisocial personality disorder, saying he 'fails to conform to social norms at times, and has gross impulsivity and marked irritability and aggressiveness'. The psychiatrist then stated that 'people with antisocial personality disorder tend to deceive and distort accounts'. Dr Denovan said there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in Mr Olsen's claims, which the digger acknowledged and attributed his earlier accounts of the incidents to his illness. But Dr Denovan handed down the decision that Mr Olsen was 'an unreliable witness'. 'I have concluded that Mr Olsen has a sincere belief that his psychiatric illness/s are due to his experiences in Vietnam, however he is an unreliable witness, and he was not exposed to the events the diagnosis of PTSD relies upon,' Dr Denovan said. 'I therefore find that on balance, Mr Olsen suffers from generalised anxiety disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and alcohol misuse.'",

Aaron Schock, a Republican from Illinois, had faced fresh questions over 170,000 miles he claimed he had driven in a car which he sold with only 80,000 miles on the odometer. He had already been in the spotlight over a series of expense claims. Along with the makeover, he billed $10,000 for a private jet trip to watch the Chicago Bears play football. 'Today, I am announcing my resignation as a Member of the United States House of Representatives effective March 31,' Schock, 33, said in a statement issued by his Capitol Hill office. Scroll down for video . Gone: Aaron Schock in the office which he redecorated in the style of Downton Abbey and for which he claimed $40,000 in expenses – which he later had to repay out of his own pocket . RED IS THE COLOR:The lavish design appointments earned Schock snickers . 'GOOD LUCK TONIGHT': Schock tweeted this Instagram selfie with singer Ariana Grande, 21, before the American  Music Awards in November . 'I do this with a heavy heart. Serving the people of the 18th District is the highest and greatest honor I have had in my life. I thank them for their faith in electing me and letting me represent their interests in Washington.' But 'the constant questions over the last six weeks,' he admitted, 'have proven a great distraction that has made it too difficult for me to serve the people of the 18th District with the high standards that they deserve and which I have set for myself.' It was a dramatic turn from just last month when he flippantly responded to complaints about his lavish office redecoration. 'Haters gonna hate,' he replied then. Schock gained a reputation as a walking lifestyle magazine, attending entertainment awards show and giving interviews about his buff physique. In November he posted a selfie on Instagram that he snapped with 21-year-old singer Ariana Grande before the American Music Awards. Other Instagram snaps in his timeline show him mugging with Pope Francis, Apple Computer CEO Tim Cook, Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, the country music band Lady Antebellum, and legendary cellist Yo-Yo Ma. REP. HARDBODY: Schock made a splash in May 2011 with this Men's Health magazine cover . THE CONGRESSMAN FROM NASHVILLE: Schock posed in 2014 with the Grammy-winning country group Lady Antebellum at an event focused on protecting musicians' intellectual property rights . 'BREAKFAST WITH A LEGEND': Schock bragged on Facebook in January 2014 that he met with famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma to talk about arts education in schools . Several other social media pictures show him speaking to reporters in his home district from behind a podium that cost $5,123 from his official ofice budget in 2009. According to Buzzfeed, the podium is a close facsimile of the one President Obama uses, complete with a circular seal – in this case, one that reads 'United States House of Representatives.' Politico was first to report Schock's resignation; his now-former district is centered on the small Illinois city of Peoria. The paper had earlier reported that he was facing new questions over his expenses: Schock had submitted claims for 170,000 miles he said he drove on Congressional business in his Chevy Tahoe. But the car, which he bought new, had just 80,000 miles on its odometer when it was sold. Schock's troubles also included accusations that he had hired a personal photographer to follow him around. He also chartered private planes and stayed in five-star hotels. He also allegedly sold his home to a donor who had built and financed it – receiving more than the property was worth. And National Journal reported last week that an outside group paid for a Schock companion, Shea Ledford, to travel to India. IPHONE AT THE READY FOR HIS HOLINESS: Schock posted online a photo of him greeting Pope Francis in January on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp . HE'S EVERYWHERE: Schock mugged with Apple Computer CEO Tim Cook in 2014 after the tech king's speech at an exclusive American Enterprise Institute event on tony Sea Island in the US state of Georgia . 'THE PRESIDENTIAL': Schock's congressional office budget covered more than $5,000 for this custom podium, styled after the one President Obama uses when he's on the road . Schock's air charters included one jaunt with staffers to a Katy Perry concert, and another in 2014 that saw him bring an entourage of 20 to New York where they reportedly did little work but saw a star-studded 'Global Citizen Festival' concert. That journey set taxpayers back $10,000; Schock justified it as a 'very legitimate trip' by noting that it coincided with a U.S. visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The festival and concert that were underwritten in part by the Peoria-based Caterpillar company. Salon reported in February that Schock had accepted a string of lavish gifts and meals in London, and hosted a September 2014 fundraiser at a Maryland golf course – 'The Aaron Schock Golf Classic' – which netted his political coffers $125,000. But his official financial disclosure documents showed no signs of the perks. Another visit to the UK saw Schock taking Ledford to several high-society meals hosted by the Prince of Wales Foundation in June 2011. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, attended one of them. The events were hosted at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and a posh London nightclub. At the time a foundation spokeswoman told Politico that Schock had been 'a guest of a guest of the Prince of Wales, so he has no involvement with the foundation and therefore wasn’t in any way, shape or form involved other than attending a dinner as a guest of a guest.' LIVIN' ON THE EDGE: Schock posed with Aerosmith front-man Steve Tyler at last year's Country Music Awards . IN HIS FACE: Schock and his staff faced the glare of TV cameras on Tuesday as new organizations scrambled to confront him about his extravagant spending and alleged ethics lapses . FIRE YOURSELF: Schock bragged on Instagram in November after he met with real estate tycoon and possible presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Trump Tower office . Separately, Schock declared on a political campaign disclosure document that he had spent money on software purchases. The expense turned out to be for a private jet trip on an aircraft owned by a software company president. Congressional rules prohibit members from accepting any a gift worth more than $50. That includes food and beverages. The guidelines provide an exception for gifts from close personal friends, but even those require written approval from the House Ethics Committee – and later public disclosure – if they exceed $250. The Associated Press confirmed Monday that the Office of Congressional Ethics was investigating Schock's high-flying lifestyle while in office. The OCE is an outside panel that reviews ethics complaints against House members and makes recommendations to the ethics committee, which is composed of equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats. That committee, however, has no authority to investigate ethics-challenged lawmakers after they quit. In a statement, House Speaker John Boehner said: 'With this decision, Rep. Schock has put the best interests of his constituents and the House first. I appreciate Aaron's years of service, and I wish him well in the future.' TRAVEL BUDDY: Schock (right) posed with longtime friend Shea Ledford (center) and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (left) for a ceremonial swearing-in picture in 2011, at the beginning of his second term in office . PRESSURE: The flamboyant Schock had faced intense media scrutiny since his scandalous spending first hit the front pages in Illinois . Rep. Aaron Schock sold this Dunlap, Illinois house to political donors who built and financed it – allegedly keeping the profits . A source in House leadership told Daily Mail Online that Schock did not give anyone notice before making his announcement. 'We were all caught by surprise,' the congressional aide said Tuesday. 'It's a long time coming, but we had no idea it would happen today.' Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group, pounced a few hours after Schock's announcement. Anne Weismann, the group's executive director,called Schock's departure 'inevitable,' noting that he 'couldn’t say just last week whether or not he had broken the law.' Her group has separately filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, which can continue to investigate. Schock is the second Republican member of the House of Representatives to quit in recent months under a cloud of scandal. Former New York Rep. Michael Grimm resigned his House seat after he agreed to plead guilty to federal tax evasion. The first order of busniess in the 114th Congress was to announce his departure.

That is when young Deonte stepped in to protect his mother, and one of the men stabbed him in the arm. Scroll down for video . Deonte Turner (above), 12, of Detroit , Michigan, stepped in to protect his mother as three masked men yelled profanities at her and demanded her money . The incident happened when Barbara Whithead (above) got out of her car in her driveway (in background) after returning home in the early hours of Tuesday . 'I told them we didn't have any damn money, but he just kept asking for money. And he kept talking really rough and in vulgar language,' Whitehead told the Detroit Free Press. 'And my son, he didn't like them talking to his mom like that.' That is when Deonte stepped in to intervene. 'He just told them don't talk to my mom like that. And then he saw it coming because he threw his arm up,' Whitehead said of the knife. 'He was like, \"My arm, my arm.\"' The men ran off immediately after, and Whitehead, 44, rushed her son to the hospital where he was treated and released later that morning. 'He didn't cry. My son didn't cry,' said Whitehead. 'He was like, \"Is Mom OK?\"' Denote placed himself between the men and his mother, at which point one of the men stabbed him in the arm . And while the mother is incredibly proud of what her son did to protect her, she does not want him risking his own safety in the future - even if it is to protect her. 'When someone asks us for something, just try to give it to them. Try to cooperate,' she said. Authorities are still searching for the three men responsible for the attack.

        "input_text": "Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy said on Thursday that two agents who allegedly 'crashed' into a White House barrier in early March while driving under the influence merely bumped into a barrel. 'Previous reports of a crash are inaccurate - there was no crash,' Clancy told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee during testimony on the agency's budget request. 'The video shows the vehicle entering the White House complex at a speed of approximately 1 to 2 mph, and pushing aside a plastic barrel. There was no damage to the vehicle.' Clancy also told senators that the Secret Service was doing everything in its power to 'recreate' surveillance footage from the night in question that had already been erased by the time he learned of the incident. A U.S. Secret Service K-9 team works along the second, temporary fence on the north side of the White House this week. Congress may never know whether two agents who crashed into a White House barrier in early March were driving under the influence because it's Secret Service policy to erase tapes after 72 hours, a congressman has revealed . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, pictured here at a Capitol Hill hearing on Tuesday, says lawmakers who were present for the Secret Service director's explanation of why tapes were destroyed were stunned. 'That doesn't make any sense to us' The newly minted Secret Service director's testimony follows the chairman of the House Oversight Committee's public disclosure on Wednesday that it is Secret Service policy to delete footage of the White House after 72 hours. Utah Republican Jason Chaffetz said Clancy offered up the policy on Tuesday at a closed-door meeting as an explanation for why he could only offer Congress video of the incident from two angles. 'I don't think anyone in that room could believe it,' Chafettz told CBS News Wednesday. 'That's just a stunning revelation that 72 hours after they make a tape they destroy it? That doesn't make any sense to us.' On Tuesday at a House hearing on his appropriations request Clancy admitted that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or crash, which interrupted a suspicious package investigation, until five days after it happened. 'The fact that I did not learn of this allegation until five days after it is said to have occurred is unacceptable,' he said today in his prepared remarks. The lapse in notification means that all evidence of a crime could have been destroyed before the time Clancy says he was informed of his agents' misconduct. 'If it's regular policy to destroy them after 72 hours, why did they have two of the tapes, and where are the rest of the tapes?' Chaffetz had asked on Wednesday. A spokesperson for the Secret Service did not return Daily Mail Online's request for comment on the matter Thursday morning. And the White House's chief spokesman declined, when asked by Daily Mail Online on Thursday, to say whether he or the president felt it was 'appropriate' for the Secret Service to delete surveillance footage with such frequency. The spokesman, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, said he would withhold judgement until Clancy had a chance to explain himself to Congress that afternoon. Clancy  later informed senators that Secret Service kept tapes related to the bomb sweep and that was how it still had video of the agents banging into the barrel. The Secret Service head allowed Congress to view one video on Thursday but said he could not make it public 'because it may be evidence' and a widespread release could 'taint future court hearings.' 'We understand it's a concern,' that additional tapes were wiped, Clancy said, according to the Washington Examiner, and 'we're doing everything we can to retrieve those images and to be as transparent as we can be.' Clancy told lawmakers that the agency had contacted the manufacturer of the device it uses to monitor the White House as well as forensics experts. The two agents involved in the March 4 episode were Mark Connolly, then the second-in-command on President Barack Obama's protective detail, and George Ogilvie, a senior-level agent in the Washington field office. They were reportedly driving back in an agency vehicle from departing Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan's going away party when they rolled through an area outside the White House that was sectioned off by yellow security tape and hit a barricade. Chaffetz told CBS that the videos he did see showed the agents coming just feet from hitting the suspected bomb, which turned out to be a non-threatening package. The footage did not show what happened afterward. 'In terms of were they drunk or inebriated, can't tell,' Chaffetz said, because the tapes did not show the agents exiting the government vehicle or driving home after the incident. 'We want to see other tapes to understand that,' he said. If they even exist - and they may not, Chaffetz acknowledged at the time. 'At this hour we are calling on the Secret Service to provide those tapes so we can see a more full and complete picture.' Clancy indicated on Thursday that he was unsure whether the agents were drunk at the time of the accident. 'I do not have the ability to simply terminate employees based solely on allegations of misconduct. This is not because I am being lenient,' he said. 'While I am extremely concerned by the allegations of misconduct and the potential for alcohol involvement, I must reserve judgment.' At the House hearing on Tuesday Clancy conceded that some Secret Service agents turn to alcohol to help them deal with the stress of their jobs. 'We’ve got to find a way to help some of these people that are going towards alcohol as a coping mechanism,' he said. Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy testifies during a House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing on the Secret Service budget on Tuesday. Clancy admitted at that hearing that he did not know about the alleged drunk driving or the crash, which interrupted a suspicious package investigation, until five days after it happened . In addition to Congress, an an inspector general is conducting an independent review of the of the affair and whether a uniformed division supervisor ignored recommendations that officers undergo field sobriety tests. Connolly and Oglivie have since been reassigned to desk jobs until the Department of Homeland Security review is concluded. Clancy is a veteran of the Secret Service who President Obama pulled out of retirement to take over the DHS agency first on an interim basis and later in perpetuity after the former head of the security arm of the department resigned following a set of serious breaches of the president's safety. The White House said this week that the president was still 'absolutely' certain that Clancy was the right man to lead the agency, which has struggled to avoid scandal and operate efficiently throughout the second term of Obama's presidency. 'This is very difficult work, and going in and reforming an agency like this will be challenging,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. 'But somebody like Director Clancy, who has the skills and the character to implement these kinds of changes, will be critical to the success of that agency. 'And the President has complete confidence in Director Clancy’s ability to implement those changes in a way that will allow the agency to live up to the high standard that they’ve set for themselves, but also to ensure that they’re properly serving the country.'",

        "input_text": "Los Angeles authorities say are working with the FBI to build a criminal case against millionaire Robert Durst's wife and she may testify against her husband to avoid criminal charges . Durst is currently being investigated for the shooting death of Susan Berman in 2000 and police say wife Debrah Lee Charatan, 58, allegedly tried to help Durst flee to Cuba before his recent arrest. The New York Post reports that Charatan, who married Durst less than two weeks before Berman's death, could face a federal charge of aiding and abetting a flight to avoid prosecution. Los Angeles authorities say are building a criminal case against millionaire Robert Durst's wife Debrah Lee Charatan (pictured in 2012 and 2014) and she may testify against her husband to avoid criminal charges . If convicted, Charatan could do up to five years behind bars. 'The wife is definitely in play, a police source told The Post. 'If she’s smart, she’ll waive [spousal privilege] and tell investigators everything she knows and put the final nail in his coffin — and then she might escape prosecution.' Durst was preparing to fly to Cuba when he was arrested on March 14 and police believe that Charatan was going to meet him there or help him flee. The Post reports that police are going over Charatan's financial records to look for money transfers or other incriminating evidence. Charatan was in Florida which is just 90 miles from Cuba when Durst was arrested in New Orleans. 'She knew this was coming and that [Durst] was going to be arrested and this was all going to blow up,' a police source told The Post. Recent arrest Robert Durst poses for a mugshot photo after being arrested for murder and detained on March 14 in New Orleans, Louisiana . On Friday, Millionaire Robert Durst's attorneys claim that he was illegally arrested on charges that he murdered Susan Berman in California, as well as drug and weapons charges filed in New Orleans. In the papers filed at the State Criminal District Court in New Orleans, William Gibbens and Dick DeGuerin asked a magistrate judge to schedule a preliminary hearing so that they can prove that there is no probable cause to keep Durst jailed. They say he should be released. 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on. ... They're gonna find nothing,\" Dick DeGuerin, the lead attorney on Durst's team, told  KTRK-TV. 'I think Louisiana and their elected officials want a piece of the publicity pie.' 'Invalid arrest': Robert Durst's legal team accused authorities in documents today of arresting the real estate heir illegally, as his attorney blasted Louisiana officials for wanting a piece of the 'publicity pie' 'I think he's an easy target and everybody's piling on ... They're gonna find nothing, Dick DeGuerin (pictured), the lead attorney on Durst's team, said on Friday . The judge agreed to schedule that hearing during another court appearance by Durst on Monday in New Orleans. The attorneys also asked the judge to order that evidence be preserved from the hotel where Durst was arrested. They are seeking any and all records related to Durst and Everett Ward, the pseudonym Durst used to check into the hotel. The documents blasted the arrest, which the attorneys say was orchestrated 'to coincide with the final episode of the HBO docudrama The Jinx. The six-part documentary concluded Sunday. Durst's arrest came shortly before the HBO finale about his links to three killings — that of his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Berman, the daughter a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared; and a 71-year-old neighbor in Texas whose dismembered body was found floating in Galveston Bay in 2001. Frail: Durst is on suicide watch at a Louisiana detention center . Durst has only ever been tried for the Texas killing, and he was acquitted of murder. Durst waived extradition in New Orleans but is being held there on charges that he was a felon in possession of a gun and with illegally carrying a weapon with a controlled substance. Court documents say investigators found nearly $43,000 in cash, a gun and a rubber mask that could cover his head and neck in his hotel room when he was arrested. Authorities have also said marijuana was found in the room. However, Durst's attorneys say his previous convictions are not serious enough to merit the gun charge. In the case, prosecutors could seek to play portions from The Jinx that concluded with the eccentric millionaire off camera talking to himself in a bathroom with his wireless microphone still live. He has been charged in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the 2000 killing Susan Berman, the daughter of a mobster and a close friend who acted as his spokeswoman after his wife disappeared in New York in 1982. Durst, 71, who is estranged from a family that has a real estate empire worth an estimated $4 billion, has long denied killing Berman and Kathleen Durst, who was declared dead even though her body was never found. Investigators had reopened that case and planned to speak with Berman when she was shot once in the back of her head at her home near Beverly Hills. After the killing, Durst disguised himself as a mute woman and moved into a cheap Galveston, Texas, boarding house where he killed an elderly neighbor in 2001. He claimed self-defense and was acquitted of murder but was convicted of unlawfully disposing of the man's body, which was found chopped up and floating in Galveston Bay. While legal experts said Durst's remarks off-camera and to filmmakers during the production will most likely be admissible, prosecutors will have to decide if they outweigh the possibility that the defense would play other portions of interviews showing him denying any killing. 'I would see this moment of unguarded truth as worth a lot of those denials,' said George Fisher, a former prosecutor and professor at Stanford Law School. 'The flat out meaning of the statement is very clear on its face.' In the case of Blake, prosecutors sought to introduce a portion of a jailhouse interview of the actor discussing his family with Barbara Walters because it contradicted other evidence. The defense then successfully pushed to bring in the rest of the interview. 'It did a great deal both to humanize him and so he wasn't just seen as a celebrity,' said M. Gerald Schwartzbach, who won Blake's acquittal on a murder charge involving the killing of his wife. 'There was an image projected that a lot of people had about Robert as a difficult person. In this video, he came across as a very sympathetic person.' Prosecutors are not commenting on the Berman case while Durst is still held in Louisiana, where he also faces firearms charges.",

Andreas Guenter Lubitz, 28, waited for his captain, Patrick Sondenheimer to leave the flight deck and go to the toilet before commanding the Airbus A-320 to descend. Once out of the cockpit, the door locked automatically. Ironically, this auto-lock feature, which led to Lubitz having sole control of the plane, was introduced as a way of improving flight safety in the wake of 9/11. Scroll down for video . The Airbus A-320 is fitted with a safety system, pictured, to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . Andreas Lubitz, pictured, locked his captain out of the cockpit and crashed the jet into the side of a mountain . The Airbus A320 is fitted with a locking mechanism to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck while the aircraft is in flight. The door was also specially strengthened, to prevent someone from being able to barge their way through. The safety systems were improved in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks where hijackers were able to gain access to the cockpit and take over the aircraft. Access to the cockpit door on the Germanwings Airbus A320 (like the one above) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking . In normal flight, the door to the flight is closed and locked. Cabin crew can use a code and gain access to the flight deck. Entry is controlled by the flight crew, in case of a possible hijack attempt. The Cockpit Door Locking System (CDLS) according to the flight manual 'provides a means of electrically locking and unlocking the cockpit door'. The CDLS is located in the central pedestal between both pilots and has a toggle switch which controls the door. They also have a CCTV camera so they can see who is seeking access, and if they are under any form of duress. Pilots can restrict access to the flight deck although cabin crew can gain entry in an emergency. However, this emergency access can be over-ridden by the pilot for between five to 20 minutes. The limited time to keep the door closed is itself a safety feature, in case the flight crew become incapacitated. After the predetermined time, the keypad on the outside of the cockpit door will become operational again, unless the pilot actively restricts access again. Also the cockpit door has several other safety features in case of a sudden decompression which will cause the door to open. According to the flight manual there are 'routine' and 'emergency' access requests. The door locking mechanism is on the centre console, pictured,  so it can be operated by either pilot . The pilot has to flick one simple switch, pictured,  to lock the cabin door for between five and 20 minutes . 'The toggle switch enables the flight crew to lock or unlock the cockpit door, following an access request, thereby allowing or denying the entry to the cockpit.' The flight manual states that the control unit is responsible for: . On the Airbus A320, there are three settings: . School friends said that Lubitz paused his pilot's training in 2008 after suffering from 'burnout' and depression. On November 29, 2013 Mozambique Airways Flight LAM 470 crashed on a scheduled passenger flight between Maputo, Mozambique and Luanda, Angola. Air crash investigators think the Embraer 190 jet was flown into the ground by the captain after his copilot went to the toilet, killing everyone. The jet's captain, Herminio dos Santos Fernandes was believed to have had serious personal problems at the time of his death. Mozambique Airways Flight LAM 470 crashed into the ground, pictured,  after the pilot locked his colleague, who went on a toilet break, out of the flight deck before commanding it to crash from 38,000 feet . When his co-pilot went to the toilet, flight data information recovered from the scene found that Fernandes manually changed the aircraft's altitude from 38,000 feet to almost 600 feet below ground level. He also pushed the aircraft's throttles back to idle and selected the jet's maximum operating speed. Chillingly, the cockpit voice recorder picked up the sound of the co-pilot pounding on the door, similar to Captain Patrick Sondenheimer's attempts to regain access to the flight deck.",

A Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer who found a colleague in his squad car covered in blood three nights after the Boston Marathon bombing frantically repeated two words into his radio 'officer down, officer down.' A recording of that radio call was played to jurors hearing the trial of accused bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, on Wednesday, as prosecutors turned to the charge that the defendant and his older brother murdered MIT police officer Sean Collier on April 18, 2013, in an unsuccessful attempt to steal his gun. Meanwhile, the MIT police chief revealed his last words to the 27-year-old officer in a wrenching fifth day of testimony in the long awaited Boston bomber trial. Chief John DiFava on Wednesday recalled chatting with Collier about an hour before his death. 'I told him to be safe, and I left,' DiFava said, adding it was the last time he saw Collier alive. The officer who found Collier, Sergeant Clarence Henniger, said he was responding to a 911 call about possible shots fired on MIT's Cambridge, Massachusetts, campus, just outside Boston. Collier had visible bullet wounds to his temple, neck and hand and was so covered in blood that Henniger struggled to pull him from his vehicle. 'I could hear gargling coming from his mouth,' Henniger testified at U.S. District Court in Boston, where the jury hearing Tsarnaev's trial will also decide whether to sentence him to death if he is convicted of killing three people and injuring 264 with a pair of homemade bombs at the April 15, 2013, race. Jurors also saw surveillance footage of two figures approaching Collier's police cruiser on the MIT campus, spending about a minute at the car, and leaving. The only visible suggestions of commotion in the video are the car's brake lights, flashing on and off. Collier's gun belt and holster were covered in blood, evidence of Tsarnaev's clumsy but unsuccessful effort to steal his handgun, prosecutors have said. Tsarnaev's attorneys opened the trial by admitting he committed the crimes of which he is accused, but are seeking to spare him the death penalty by demonstrating he was following the lead of his older brother. Scroll down for video... Evidence: This forensics photograph released by the U.S. Attorney's office and presented during the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev shows a bloodied service pistol sitting on seat of MIT Police Officer Sean Collier's cruiser . 'Be safe': MIT Police Chief John DiFava testified he told Collier to 'be safe' about an hour before he was shot dead April 18, 2013 . Culpable? Tsarnaev's attorney says Dzhohkar's brother Tamerlan was the mastermind of the bombing and the one who pulled the trigger to kill Collier. Prosecutors say both brothers were culpable in the officer's murder and that they killed the 27-year-old in order to steal his gun and arm Tsarnaev . In the act? Video taken from above the site of Collier's April 18 murder purports to show the Tsarnaev brothers (circled) rounding a corner toward Collier's cruiser, at left (grab via WCVB) Federal prosecutors contend Tsarnaev, who emigrated with his family from Chechnya a decade before the attack, was driven by an extremist view of Islam and a desire to take revenge on the United States for military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries. Prosecutor William Weinreb said in his opening statement last week that it was unclear if Tsarnaev or his brother fired the weapon that killed Collier but argued that both brothers were equally culpable in the officer's death. A graduate student at MIT, Nathan Harman, who was bicycling on campus the night of the murder, testified on Wednesday that he saw Tsarnaev leaning into the driver's side door of Collier's car, but did not see the older sibling. 'I only saw the one person,' said Harman, referring to Dzhokhar. 'He sort of snapped up, stood up and turned around, and he looked startled…And then I just didn't think anything of it and rode off.' Aftermath: A damaged white jersey, worn by Boston Marathon bombing survivor Jessica Kensky during the blast, is displayed to the media in a conference room after the conclusion of the day's session . Explosion: The twisted, charred remnants of a homemade pressure cooker bomb that exploded during the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 .

The court was also shown CCTV footage of Tsarnaev withdrawing $800 from an ATM using a credit card he had just stolen during a carjacking three days after the bombings . Harman said he assumed Tsarnaev was an MIT student. 'I remember thinking he had a big nose, but nothing beyond that really,' he said. Jurors also heard testimony on .

Two men in hazardous materials suits put numbers on the shattered glass and debris as they investigate the scene at the first bombing on Boylston Street in Boston in 2013 . Prosecutors also presented shredded pieces of a black and white backpack that they contend 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, used to carry their homemade bombs. The FBI agent also told the court that investigators found shrapnel along with ball bearings, a zipper, shards of metal, small nails and duct tape in the aftermath of the explosion. A bombing survivor told the court earlier this week that the victims' injuries were difficult to heal and became infected because of the 'dirty' nature of the bombs packed with small pieces of metal. DeLair showed  a piece of wire collected amid the wreckage on Boylston Street on April 15, 2013. The wire, she testified in U.S. District Court in Boston, was part of one of the bomb's detonators. 'It's the part of the bomb that would make it go off,' DeLair said. She took pictures of the . dead and coordinated efforts to recover 'everything from human . remains to bomb components to parts of backpacks,' she said on Wednesday.

Boston, moments before his violent capture. The note accuses the United States government of killing . Muslims and says 'I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished'. It adds: 'I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in . Islam but due to said (...) it is allowed.' Words were missing . from the note due to bullet holes. Jurors were also presented with Tsarnaev's Twitter posts, . which ranged from jokes about girls, food, and homework, to . musings about Islam and a reference to the Sept. 11, 2001, . attacks on New York and Washington. After opening with three days of emotional and graphic testimony by witnesses including nine people injured in the attack, Tsarnaev's trial has moved into to a more technical phase as prosecutors show evidence about the bombs and communication between the two brothers. Despite the admission that opened the trial, Tsarnaev's not guilty plea stands, leaving it to the federal government to prove his guilt before the trial moves into a second phase, when the jury will determine whether to sentence him to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole.

        "input_text": "Slasher: Richard White, 63, died in hospital Saturday afternoon, the night after he was gunned down while trying to hack a TSA worker to death . The machete-wielding maniac who was gunned down as he tried to hack a TSA worker to death has died in hospital. Richard White, 63, charged at Carol Richel at a security checkpoint inside New Orleans airport Friday evening - but was stopped in his tracks by a female cop. He was carrying a sack of six Molotov cocktails during the attack, but was not able to detonate them. Lt Heather Slyve, of the Jefferson Parish sheriff's department, shot White in the chest, the thigh and the face as he lunged at Richel. He was rushed to hospital Friday evening and went into surgery, but died of his wounds around 4pm Saturday, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Earlier that day Richel had hailed Lt Slyve as her 'hero', saying she would certainly be dead if it weren't for her fatal intervention. Speaking at a press conference, Richel said: 'Officer Slyve is my hero. She saved my life. 'The man was within inches of whacking me with the machete and she did save my life, and saved probably a lot of others.' When he was shot, White was carrying a bag loaded with six Molotov cocktails - Mason jars with cloth wicks soaked in gasoline - Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said. There was also reportedly a barbeque lighter and a letter opener in his bag, while smoke bombs and tanks of acetelyne (an explosive), Freon (an aerosol) and oxygen were discovered in the trunk of White's parked car. Scroll down for video . Saved: TSA employee Carol Richel, above, was inches from being slash by White. She today paid tribute to Lt Heather Slyve, the cop who saved her from the attack at New Orleans's Louis Armstrong International Airport . Dead: White is pictured above last night being wheeled out of the airport. He was in surgery last night but died 4pm Saturday of his wounds . Gunned down: White is pictured above where he fell, not far from the machete . But despite his stash of weapons, he only managed to spray several people with the insecticide, and swing his machete without hitting anybody before he was shot. In the struggle Richel herself was hit by one of Lt Slyve's shots. She later explained that she and her colleagues are trained for such situations, saying: 'It was second nature'. She explained: 'We want to make sure the passengers are safe, so we tell them \"run, run, you've got to get out of here, run\". And with that, we know they're leaving,' according to CNN. However, Richel said that because TSA officials do not carry guns, she was forced to rely on police to save her life, saying: 'They're the ones there with the weapons to be able to protect us.' 'Second nature': During the press conference, Richel (pictured front) said she and her colleagues had been trained how to react in such a situation, saying: 'It was second nature'. She said passenger safety came first . Injured: White was in possession of a bag loaded with six Molotov cocktails when he launched the attack, Sheriff Newell Normand said. Above, Richel is pictured being transported to an ambulance via stretcher . 'Senseless act of violence': This statement was posted on the TSA's Twitter page on Saturday afternoon . After White attacked two security officials and a number of passersby with the wasp spray at the airport's security checkpoint, he drew his machete from the waistband of his pants. He then started swinging the weapon, which a male TSA agent managed to block with a piece of luggage as White ran through a metal detector, Normand said earlier on Saturday. Seconds later, White began chasing Richel, prompting Lt Slyve to fire three rounds at him, striking him the face, chest and leg. White was then rushed to hospital, where he had surgery. According to authorities, residue from smoke bombs was  found near White's body at the security checkpoint. Hurt: An injured man - possibly a passenger who was hurt while fleeing the scene - is pictured at the airport . On guard: Police clear out the area around Concourse B of Louis Armstrong International Airport on Friday evening . Emergency response: Police poured into the airport  and ushered everybody away from the area where the shooting took place . The sheriff suggested that White has had 'mental health' issues. He is a Jehovah's Witness and has refused 'certain types of medical care,' Normand said. His family is cooperating with investigators. 'Fortunately, he didn't seriously injure anybody,' Normand said. Richel, a Supervisory Security Officer for the Transportation Security Administration, was struck in the arm by one of Lt Slyve's rounds while running from White. Her wound was quickly deemed non-life-threatening. She was treated in hospital and released hours later. Earlier reports had wrongly stated that Richel was slashed by White's machete. Photographs from inside Louis Armstrong International Airport Friday showed White laying on the floor with a machete close-by. Another showed a woman in a TSA uniform being stretchered away. Attack: White reportedly began swinging the weapon at the airport's security checkpoint, which a male TSA agent managed to block with a piece of luggag. Above, officers stand at the entrance to the airport . Other images depicted police flooding the area outside the terminal. On Saturday, bystanders described minutes of panic and chaos at the airport in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner. 'Everyone was ducking for cover. It's New Orleans. I knew they (the gunshots) were coming from the security checkpoint area,' said Garret Laborde, 31, a traveler trying to fly to Houston. 'I immediately ducked down... Then we waited.' He called the scene 'instant chaos' with 'screaming, lots of females screaming for a short period of time.' Laborde said he remained down for several minutes, before police began rushing around the airport, telling everyone to get back down. Evaucation sirens also started going off, he said. Disruptive: Long lines of fliers were seen awaiting word of their departures in the airport's ticketing area on Friday evening . Protected: Officers guard the entrance to concourse A and B at the New Orleans International Airport on Friday . Logan Tucker, 26, of Meridian, Mississippi, and Phillip Green, 33, of Houston, both headed to Houston for work as deckhands on a tugboat, said they were close to where events unfolded. 'I heard the gunshots,' Tucker said. 'It was pandemonium after that,' Green said. 'I took cover. I didn't want to become part of the story. The Sheriff's Office said Friday there was no obvious connection between White and the airport. A spokesman said: 'We don't know if he was traveling. We're still piecing together witness interviews.' On Saturday, a statement revealed that White  'had a few minor arrests' to his name. At a news conference outside the airport, Normand described Friday's encounter in detail. A deputy walks through Concourse B at the airport as the sheriff's department investigates the attack . He said: 'He walked down the TSA pre-line, encountered the TSA officer who was checking the boarding passes with the scanning machine to be scanned. 'He was challenged at that time by the TSA officer. The response was, he pulled a can of wasp spray and sprayed the officer in the face. 'He proceeded past that checkpoint and encountered the second TSA officer and a third a third TSA officer almost simultaneously. One was a female, one was a male. 'He sprayed the male in the face.' Describing the shooting, he said: 'The law enforcement officer proceeded down the exit line to come around, coming in very close contact to the individual with the machete, and that officer fired three times, hitting the perpetrator once in the left chest, the left facial area and the left thigh, at that point in time. Scene: The shooting and machete attack took place at Louis Armstrong International Airport on Friday night . 'There was an innocent bystander who sustained a graze wound to the arm and there were a couple of members of the traveling public, while in the scrambling, while shots were fired, that happened to cut some limbs on some of the furniture there while trying to get away from that particular area.'",

        "input_text": "It's probably not the sort of substance you'd expect bikies to use to smuggle steroids into the country but the body-building drugs market is now considered so lucrative, estimated at a billion dollars in some quarters, that outlaw motorcycle gangs are using 'gay lube oil' to try and hide the ill-gotten gear. Australians spend up to $10 billion on fitness each year and a large chunk of that money now goes on illegal substances - and criminal syndicates have muscled in on the illegal part of the fitness industry, using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection. Steroid oil in sex lube vials, powders inside green tea packets and ephedrine packed in facial creams, are just some of the methods being used to avoid being caught. With criminal syndicates having had their supply of amphetamines and cocaine severely affected by a record number of busts, they have increasingly focused on the body-building market and are being supplied by underworld gangs in south-east Asia and the Americas. The steroid market is now considered so lucrative, outlaw bikie gangs have muscled in on the illegal industry and they're using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection, including place the substances inside sex aid packaging like these, labelled 'gay lube oil' Australian Police say bikie gangs have now shifted focus heavily into the steroid market as authorities crack down on cocaine and amphetamine crime syndicates . Some estimate the illegal market in steroids across Australia could be worth up to a billion dollars with Australians spending almost $10 billion on fitness each year . Over the past decade, the number of performance and image enhancing drugs detected at the Australian border has increased 7-fold, with South Australia recording the biggest percentage increase. Motorcycle gangs are trying to avoid detection by putting steroid oil inside products labelled 'sexual lubrication' 'They are getting amongst it more and more, it's a different market for them and we are regularly staging operations targeting them and steroids,' revealed Detective Superintendent Mick Niland, the head of Queensland's Taskforce Maxima. 'They try many different ways to avoid detection, that's for sure.' And that's because there is an increasing demand for the illegal performance enhancing substances, one which continues to grow every year. At one Gold Coast health clinic alone, there have been up to 150 steroid injections reported in one month. Queensland and New South Wales are considered the hot-beds in steroid production and trade with South Australia, reporting the biggest (percentage) increase in the number of seizures in a year, registering just 1 in 2012 and then 30 in 2013. 'Half of our seizures in the past few months have been about steroids,' Dept Supt Niland added. 'They are always trying different ways to avoid detection,' said Mick Niland of Tasforce Maxima as his group battles against the increasing trade in steroids by bikie gangs and the methods used to avoid detection . The Bandidos and Lone Wolf bikie gangs have been targeted in raids by authorities trying to break their hold on the new business of steroids distribution . Queensland police busted a Wavell Heights operation in January, arresting a husband and wife over this haul . Steroid seizures and arrests are climbing every year, they are now at record levels and show no sign of declining, with the trade controlled by the motorcycle gangs, who are increasingly using the back of stores and city garages, instead of gyms and their traditional club-houses, to sell the illicit products. It's not just the 20-something gym junkies they're selling to, recent surveys have revealed that up to 3 per cent of 12 to 17-year-old school students have admitted to using  steroids to bulk up. Taskforce Maxima commenced in October of 2013 and 'initially we did find just small quantities of steroids within the gangs'. 'Since then it has grown, both the local production and trafficking of steroids.' In the past six months alone, Customs has intercepted more than 3000 packages of steroids, from all parts of the globe. Outlaw motorcycle gangs have muscled in on the illegal part of the fitness industry, using extraordinary methods to try and avoid detection of steroid shipments . Customs officials are finding steroids secreted in a variety of manners, including pills and powder inside herbal products and even green tea packaging. They are even importing ephedrine in women's facial creams . Tasforce Maxima, along with officials from the AFP and Customs, raided 10 properties across parts of Queensland, arresting 7 people and locating 200 vials of Human Growth Hormone . Half of our seizures in the past few months have been about steroids,' Detective Superintendent Mick Niland has revealed. He is the head of Queensland's Taskforce Maxima, which investigates the dealings of outlaw bikies gangs . In the past six months alone, Customs has intercepted more than 3000 packages of steroids, from all parts of the globe. During one raid, police answered a knock at the door - it was a courier delivering another package of steroids sent from the US to the same address . One dose of Human Growth Hormone (HGH) can cost about $500, a vial of testosterone for more than $200 but there are other substances which can be bought on the black market for as little as $50 for a 10-week course. Most users find it easier and safer to pay more locally, rather than order the drugs themselves, from overseas. 'They are brought in from all over,' Det Supt Niland said. 'Europe, the US and mostly south-east Asia, quite a lot from Thailand and also China. 'We've set up a close alliance with Customs and other strategic partners, including the AFP and other national anti-gangs units and conducted a number of investigations, and in particular we've seen the trafficking and production linked to the Lone Wolf and Bandidos gangs.' A caes full of PIEDs. Officers seized large quantities of illegal performance and image-enhancing drugs after searching a property in Adelaide's south . Customs uncovered this haul of steroids during an operation at Gold Coast Airport. Bikies are trying to disguise their illicit substances inside sex aid bottles, facial creams and herbal teas . He revealed that the Taskforce most recently busted a major syndicate involving bikies, personal trainers and supplement stores, in 10 raids across Queensland. Over the past decade, the number of performance and image enhancing drugs detected at the Australian border has increased 7-fold, with the 10,356 detections in the year 2012–13. That was a record number, which was exceeded last year and will be again this time around when figures are collated by the Australian Crime Commission in three months. The use of performance and image-enhancing drugs (PIEDs), is now so bad that many gyms have been forced to put syringe disposal bins in place, to ensure the safety of other gym members. The problem for local authorities, is that the local bikie gangs have linked with criminal syndicates overseas. 'It is all  linked to criminal partners off-shore and one major issue, of course, is the accessibility via the internet,' he said. Det Supt Niland revealed that during a recent raid in Brisbane, detectives even took delivery from a courier. 'They were conducting a search when the courier arrived and delivered a package which had been sent form the United States to the same address, where they were making arrests. 'There were 300 ampoules full of injectable steroids inside the package.' Over the past six months, the Queensland Taskforce has made 73 arrests for possession, production and trafficking in steroids .. after raids in more than 50 properties. 'It's very much Gold Coast and Brisbane based where the majority of steroids are being located, but steroids have been located over the length and breadth of Queensland,' he added. Part of the bust at Gold Coast Airport which netted 29,000 steroid tablets . Customs and Border Protection officers in WA found these body-building drugs and weapons inside a case at Perth Airport . 'This is a trans-national crime, there are no borders for the bikies at the present time, there's movement across not just the state, but also national and international borders. 'The trafficking which is occurring ranges from the low level personal use to imported raw steroid powders which are then produced into injectable varieties, from south-east Asia primarily. 'It was once a boutique market, which is growing rapidly and they are not just selling, they are using as well and we are very well aware of the effects it has when they are using.' The Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission reports that: 'There has been an increase in the use of Performance and Image Enhancing Drugs (PIED) by younger people, particularly male adolescents, motivated by body image rather than performance.' 'PIEDs are diverted for misuse and supply through a range of sources, including the internet.' 'The likelihood of the illicit market continuing to expand will be dictated by the demand for the substance and the ability of suppliers (whether they be individuals or organised syndicates) to continue to access and import required quantities. Should this happen, it is likely that there will be an increase in this market.' That market is clearly on the rise, with up to 10 per cent of those using needle exchanges now admitting to injecting steroids - up from 2 per cent just seven years ago.",
        "summary": "Bikie gangs have taken control of the illegal substance trade in Australia .\nThey order cheaper versions of anabolic steroids from south-east Asia off the internet and on-sell to customers .\nDrugs are concealed inside everything from sex aids to women's facial creams and even green tea to try and avoid detection at the border .\nOutlawed gangs also bringing in the powdered form before turning that into the injectable liquid inside their labs .\nSales are often made from the back of shops and garages .\nHuman growth hormone sales can be worth $500 for a single dose but others varieties are sold for as little as $50 ."

        "input_text": "A 29-year-old woman who once weighed as little as 39 kilos has revealed how she transformed her figure to become a bodybuilding champion – and why she has refused to give up the gym after becoming pregnant. In her early twenties Marika Magriplis, from Sydney, used to be too small for an Australian dress size six while working in a corporate job and living off a diet of convenience food including noodles and cheap burgers. Today - after overhauling her diet and lifestyle in 2010 - she’s just two weeks from giving birth to her first child and credits exercise and nutrient-rich meals with her 'having nothing to whinge about while pregnant’. ‘I don’t know if I’ve been lucky with my diet and lifestyle but I’ve got away with very minimal side effects with this pregnancy,’ Marika told Daily Mail Australia. Her feet ‘only swelled up once’ and instead of wishing to indulge in sweat treats her only craving has been ‘tuna with vinegar’. Scroll down for video . 'In the last week he has had another spurt... 22 days to go': Marika Magriplis, who is nine months pregnant (left), has credited working out (right) with keeping nasty pregnancy side effects at bay . The 29-year-old, a qualified personal trainer and competitive bodybuilder, ditched her unhealthy lifestyle in 2010 . Since 2012, when she first began competing in bodybuilding competitions around Australia, Marika has spent six days of the week weight training and eating a protein-rich diet. After becoming pregnant she adapted her training, with the help of experts, by reducing her weight sessions each trimester and including more calorie-dense foods into her diet to feed her growing bump. ‘My training became more about core strengthening than building,’ Marika said. ‘Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off. At one stage – about halfway through my pregnancy I had really bad back pain because I made the weights too light - my body needed the strength,’ she explained. However, now with just 14 days until her due date Marika has stopped weight-lifting altogether as she prepares to become a mum. Marika explained that she has kept up weights during pregnancy to maintain strength, not to build muscle like before . Marika's amazing transformation from a tiny 39 kilos to a strong bodybuilder came after she began lifting weights and learning about nutrition . ‘Physically I’ve made peace and listen to my body now and I’ve dropped back on the training side of things. Now it’s a about prenatal yoga and a lot of stretching and preparing the body for birth.’ Marika, who is now a qualified personal trainer, weighed 39 kilos in 2007 after graduating from uni. ‘I was tiny just through lack of knowledge… health wasn’t a priority it was just about making money,’ she explained. When she was competing as a bodybuilder before she was pregnant, Marika's daily diet would include: . Morning . An omelette with two whole eggs and three egg whites with cucumber or broccoli or green beans on the side. 'Its sounds odd for breakfast but it has everything you need, essential fats and fibre  from the veg and protein from the egg whites,' Marika said. Lunch . Fish or chicken, basically a lean white protein, with some salad and some nuts. Snack . Greek yoghurt (around 150 grams) with a handful of nuts and some protein powder. Dinner . White or sweet potato with meat and veg. 'I would have carbs after weight training. It breaks all the rules but if you think about your body as a machine, you need to refuel and  carbs work as energy. 'If you have fats in the morning, keeping them separately for different needs,' Marika explained. Exercise . Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding. After weights she would have a banana and a protein shake. On day seven Marika would balance weights with a slow walk along the beaches near her home. This was her 'active recovery day'. Marika said one of her favourite core exercises before she was pregnant was 'hanging leg raises'. After she became pregnant with her first child, Marika took advice from her chiropractor, midwife and physio and adapted her workout routine and diet. Morning . Multi-grain bread, oats, or muesli with fruit. Or eggs on toast. Snack . Greek yoghurt and nuts. Or a nut and muesli bar when nauseous. 'I couldn’t even think about eating chicken and greens. The thought of it just made me want to throw up, it was a big adjustment,' Marika said. Lunch . Tuna as well as fresh fruit. Dinner . Similar to before pregnancy. 'I started to think cravings were a myth and I only had indigestion once in my whole pregnancy,' Marika said. 'I also alkalised my body with alkaline greens, that’s really important to help prevent acid reflux. 'Also fish oil capsules have helped with my brain function and baby's developing brain.' Exercise . 'I didn’t really change until the 10 week mark and then I really started to slow down a bit and reduced my weights to four days a week. 'The second trimester I did about three days a week of strength training then a walk or cycle on the other three days just because I felt better being active. 'In the third trimester I have tapered right back to two or three weight sessions a week up until the 36 week mark where I thought \"OK I just cant’ do it any more\". 'I had to find an alternative, with walking and prenatal yoga and walking in the lap pool.' ‘I was in advertising and marketing and worked in the corporate world for a good few years and then decided to transition into a personal trainer because I loved my fitness and wanted to combine my passion with work so I could be happy all the time,’ Marika said. The brunette had always been active and ran cross country at national level at school and struggled to gain weight. 'Maintaining my strength helped to take the load off,' says Marika who has a naturally small frame . Marika explained this photo was taken on 'one of leanest days' of her life while she was competing in bodybuilding . Marika said she has received a lot of criticism online from people who 'aren't educated around the topic' Marika began weight training six days a week after hiring a coach to get her into shape for competitive bodybuilding . ‘I didn’t feel womanly so I sort of talked to a girlfriend and made the move into the gym to get more toned. I felt skinny fat and she said “you just have to do some weights and you won’t be so skinny any more”,’ Marika recalled. Her friend was pregnant while they trained together and Marika was guided by a coach for her move into competitive body building. Her coach, John Davies, taught her to eat high-protein foods and carbohydrates as needed. The knowledge she learned then has helped her through her pregnancy. For example, while feeling nauseous in the first 12 weeks she would snack on a nut or muesli bar to give her strength. As she awaits the arrival of her baby boy, Marika’s midwife told her ‘being fit has helped you’. Marika's partner Luke Schembri is also a competitive bodybuilder.

        "input_text": "The White House says President Obama will offer congratulations to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following his come-from-behind election victory, but not until after a coalition government is formed 'days' from now. The U-turn comes hours after Obama political strategy director David Simas added fuel to U.S.-Israeli tensions by stopping short of congratulating Netanyahu – and instead only patting Israelis on the back for voting. 'We want to congratulate the Israeli people for the democratic process – for the election that they just engaged in, with all the parties that engaged in that election,' Simas had said. Aboard Air Force One, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that Obama plans to call Netanyahu 'in the coming days.' COLD SHOULDER: The Obama administration initially offered congratulations only to the Israeli people – for holding an election – and the president won't call Netanyahu for days. The two leaders are pictured during an October 2014 meeting in the Oval Office . White House Director of Political Strategy David Simas said Wednesday morning that the White House wouldn't 'weigh in one way or another' on Netanyahu's crushing electoral win . CRUSHED IT: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ruling Likud Party scored a resounding victory in the country's election . DESIGNATED GROVELER? Secretary of State John Kerry was tapped to call Netanyahu on behalf of the White House – and made the call in the midst of nuclear negotiations with Israeli enemy Iran . The president's past practice, Earnest said, has been to wait until Israel's president formally asks Netanyahu to form a coalition government. That, judging from history, could take about a week. John Kerry phoned him, Earnest said, on behalf of the State Department – while he was in Switzerland negotiating with Iran over its nuclear ambitions. The White House's chief spokesman also said the administration is 'deeply concerned' about anti-Arab rhetoric that the Netanyahu campaign leveraged in its larger-than-expected win – and will make sure Bibi hears about it. The rhetoric 'sought to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens,' Earnest said, according to a White House pool report filed from Cleveland, Ohio. 'The United States and this administration is deeply concerned about rhetoric that seeks to marginalize Arab-Israeli citizens,' he added. 'It undermines the values and Democratic ideals that have been important to our democracy and an important part of what binds the United States and Israel together. 'Rhetoric that seeks to marginalize one segment of their population is deeply concerning and it is divisive and I can tell you that these are views the administration intends to communicate directly to the Israelis.' BY THE NUMBERS: Netanyahu's Likud party won 30 seats in the Israeli Knesset, enough to put together a ruling coalition of at least 61 seats by working with other right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties like Yisrael Betenu and Shas . JUBILANT: Supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrate as election results come in at his election campaign headquarters . Obama drew fire two weeks ago for refusing to meet with Netanyahu when he visited Washington for an historic speech to a joint meeting of Congress that was arranged behind his back. And conservatives howled when his former top campaign organizer, Jeremy Bird, turned up in Tel Aviv as the leader of a group working to oust Netanyahu – aided by a $350,000 State Department grant paid out last year. Netanyahu was quick to condemn what he called funding 'from abroad' of the group, called V15, whose stated goal was to remove him from power. But when the dust settled, Bibi's Likud party had won 30 seats in Israel's Knesset, while its chief rival the Zionist Union collected just 24. That result is strong enough for Netanyahu to build a governing coalition with other right-wing and center-right parties – and remain as prime minister. The White House has barely kept its dislike for Netanyahu concealed in recent months. The Israeli leader is among the world's harshest critics of the administration's efforts to negotiate a nuclear agreement with Iran, and it's thought that Obama would have preferred to deal with Zionist Union head Isaac Herzog. 'We're not going to weigh in one way or another,' Simas told CNN after 99 per cent of the votes were counted, 'except to say that the United States and Israel have a historic and close relationship and that will continue going forward.' TROUBLE: Jeremy Bird, the one-time director of Obama's electoral organizing campaign, worked to oust Netanyahu thruogh a group that got $350,000 in State Department funds in 2014 . BIBI ON TOP: The election was widely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who has governed the country for the past six years. Pictured are Netanyahu supporters cheering as the results come in . He wrote: 'Against all odds: a great victory for the Likud. A major victory for the people of Israel!' CONFETTI: Likud party supporters react with joy after hearing exit poll results in Tel Aviv . Recent opinion polls indicated Netanyahu was in trouble, giving Herzog a slight lead. Exit polls showed the two sides deadlocked but once the actual results came pouring in early Wednesday, Likud soared forward. Even before the final results were known, Netanyahu declared victory and pledged to form a new government quickly. 'Against all odds, we achieved a great victory for the Likud,' Netanyahu told supporters at election night headquarters. 'I am proud of the people of Israel, who in the moment of truth knew how to distinguish between what is important and what is peripheral, and to insist on what is important.' Herzog said on Wednesday he had spoken with  Netanyahu to congratulate him on his election victory. 'A few minutes ago I spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and congratulated him on his achievement and wished him luck,' Herzog told reporters. HOPEFUL: Zionist Union supporters chant for victory. In the end their party won just 24 seats . Support: Norris in his YouTube video . Netanyahu received a boost to his campaign from martial arts movie star Chuck Norris. In a YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people. 'I have done three movies in Israel – \"Delta Force\" being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way. 'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. You see, we the American people need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too. 'So I ask you, please, for the sake of Israel and the whole Middle East, vote for Prime Minister Netanyahu on Election Day.' He said his leftist Zionist Union party would continue to be an alternative to Netanyahu's right-wing Likud. Netanyahu focused his campaign on security issues, while his opponents instead pledged to address the country's high cost of living and accused the leader of being out of touch with everyday people. His return to power for a fourth term likely spells trouble for Mideast peace efforts and could further escalate tensions with the United States. Netanyahu, who already has a testy relationship with President Barack Obama, took a sharp turn to the right in the final days of the campaign, staking out a series of hard-line positions that will put him at odds with the international community. In a dramatic policy reversal, he said he now opposes the creation of a Palestinian state – a key policy goal of the White House and the international community. He also promised to expand construction in Jewish areas of east Jerusalem, the section of the city claimed by the Palestinians as their capital. Netanyahu infuriated the White House early this month when he delivered a speech to the U.S. Congress criticizing an emerging nuclear deal with Iran. The speech was arranged with Republican leaders and not coordinated with the White House ahead of time. In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama was confident strong U.S.-Israeli ties would endure far beyond the election regardless of the victor. Netanyahu will still need the support of Moshe Kahlon, whose upstart Kulanu party captured 10 seats and whose campaign focused almost entirely on bread-and-butter economic issues. He is expected to become the country's next finance minister.",

A report by the Florida Department of Children and Families says an investigator came to the home of Jessica McCarty in Palm Beach, where she admitted taking sleeping pills and muscle relaxers before texting a friend that she was going commit suicide. Investigators labeled her three children Laci McCarty, aged seven, six-year-old Philip McCarty and Christopher Swist, aged five months, as being in intermediate danger, reports Wesh.com . The children's grandmother told investigators that McCarty, 33, had twice before attempted to kill herself. According to the report, DCF gave the family a brochure, had them sign a safety plan and closed the case. Scroll down for video . Sole survivor: Police said Monday five-month-old Christopher Swist (right), died  three days after his mother Jessica McCarty killed his two older siblings in a botched murder-suicide. McCarty (pictured on the left in a suicide-protection vest with bandages on her slashed wrists) survived the attack and was arrested . What happened to the happy family? McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Laci McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself . McCarty was arrested after she called 911 on Friday and told police she'd killed her children. Laci and Philip were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children since Friday but lost his fight for life on Monday. McCarty has been charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. The attempted murder charge could be upgraded. 'Our hearts go out to the friends and family who have lost children in such a horrific manner. The fathers of these helpless, innocent children struggling is simply gut wrenching,' said acting Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens. Police say none of the three murdered children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were discovered . According to Renkens, there had recently been a break in the relationship between McCarty and the youngest child's father, also called Christopher Swist. Investigators said McCarty sent photos to Swist of blood throughout the house. Swist arrived first at the scene and found his son unresponsive on his bed, police said. Police said they found a journal in the driveway of the home that was addressed 'To my family,' which indicated that McCarty was sorry for what she 'had to do.' Letter left behind: Investigators say McCarty left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do'. The motive for the attempted murder-suicide is still not clear . There was also another page addressed to Christopher's father, asking him to keep her son's name alive, police said. On Sunday, McCarty waived her right to appear at her first hearing, sending her attorney instead. In a mugshot provided by the local jail, the troubled mother appears in a suicide-prevention vest with bandages covering her recently-slashed wrists - her mouth agape. The motive for the tragic attempted murder-suicide has still not been revealed. However, McCarty did have a troubled history and in 2009 was investigated by the DCF for possible child neglect. The agency recommended McCarty to mental health counseling after that investigation, according to public records. She has also been arrested on charges of forgery, shoplifting, and prescription drug abuse. Police were first called to the family's residence just before 6pm, when McCarty called 911 to say her three children were dead and that she had cut her wrists. Christopher Swist, the father of the infant, also called police when he came home to find the children unconscious in a bedroom. Phillip McCarty (left) was the father of the two older children Jessica is believed to have killed on Friday night . Seven-year-old Laci (right) and six-year-old Philip (left) were pronounced dead shortly after they were found . Disturbing find: McCarty's partner Christopher Swist came home on Friday to find his son (pictured together above) and McCarty's two other children unconscious. The older McCarty children were pronounced dead on Friday. The infant was found with a cord wrapped around his neck and spent the weekend on life support . McCarty allegedly sent pictures of blood inside the home to Swist, leading him to come home and investigate. When he came home, he found his son with a cord wrapped around his neck and lying on a bed. Philip unresponsive in a corner and Laci unresponsive and wounded on a bed. An autopsy on the two McCarty children was scheduled for Sunday. Palm Bay police apprehended McCarty outside her home shortly after she called 911. Officers said they had to shoot her with beanbag rounds because she was 'uncooperative' and was armed with a butcher's knife. Jessica McCarty had her two older children with Phillip (left) before having a third with Chris Swist . Jailed: McCarty, pictured left with partner Chris Swist and her two eldest children Laci and Philip and right again with Chris Swist. She was treated for her injuries and then booked in jail where she is being held without bond . McCarty was in the front yard when apprehended, but she 'wasn't showing her hand' after several requests to do so. She then showed she was holding a knife and refused to put it down, police said. After refusing several requests to put down the knife, police said officers shot McCarty with five to six less-lethal 'beanbag' rounds, which are meant to subdue a person. McCarty was treated for her injuries and taken into custody, according to WFTV. The tragic incident has shaken the community and a prayer vigil for the three murdered children was scheduled for 8pm on Monday night. Following news of little Christopher's death, friends of his father started an outpouring of support on Facebook. According to his profile, Christopher Swist is a former Marine.",

        "input_text": "The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Arizona boyfriend killer Jodi Arias by voting not to give her the death penalty is speaking out in her own defense. The 33-year-old known anonymously as Juror 17 says she's received death threats and widespread ridicule ever since she remained unmoved by 'brutal' jury room debates and an attempt to have her booted from the jury. In a multi-part interview with KPNX in which 17 will no doubt explain her obstinance, the mother of three maintained she entered the trial simply to serve her civic duty and denied allegations she was some 'stealth juror' intent on saving the infamous murderer's life. Speaking out: The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Jodi Arias this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule . Juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with Arias prosecutor Juan Martinez, facts that would not be revealed until after the March 5 deadlock announcement. 'It wasn't easy, I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it,' she said. 'All I did was answer the questions truthfully. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want this pressure.' Mostly, those questions revolved around what Juror 17 knew about the case going in, which, she insists, was very little. She will live: The latest Arias trial became the second to end in a jury deadlock. This one means the killer may not be handed the death penalty . 'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX. 'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.' When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would. However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose. Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail. Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection. 'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.' Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on. 'Not recognizing Juan Martinez is like saying you don't recognize Mickey at Disney,' tweeted @Kristyannasmom. '@katiecoolady wrote: 'bad enough my tax dollar$ went to a victim trashing defense, now to see a $tealth #juror17 entered the trial, enough is enough #jodiarias' '#juror17...your lies and deception caused so much pain and heartache that can never be taken back!!!' wrote @tarakelley320. Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago . Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago. 'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying. The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing. Outrage: Social media critics have lashed out at Juror 17 with claims she was a 'stealth juror' out to save Arias, that she had it in for the prosecutor and with threats to her and her family . Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial . 'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement. Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, said the leaks won't change the outcome of the case, noting that mistrial decisions can't be appealed. Arias was convicted of murder in Alexander's death at a 2013 trial that became a global sensation with its revelations about her sexual relationship with the victim and that she had slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. A new jury was picked to decide her punishment after the first jury deadlocked on that question. Lifetime movie: Juror 17 admitted to seeing the Lifetime film about the case (above) in 'bits and pieces' while being screened for her service. Her fellow jurors would later use this to try to get her removed from the jury . A mistrial was declared after five days of deliberations, removing the death penalty as a possible punishment for Arias. The judge is scheduled to decide on April 13 whether Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison or she will be eligible for release after serving 25 years. Most of the jurors said last week that they believed the holdout was biased and opposed to giving the death penalty. Judge Sherry Stephens had individually questioned some of the jurors, including the holdout, who said she wasn't socializing at lunch with other jurors in an effort to be impartial. Stephens said the holdout had disclosed, before being picked as a juror, that she had seen the Lifetime movie about the Arias case, but never watched it all the way through. The judge said the holdout juror didn't commit misconduct because she clearly disclosed that she had seen the movie. The judge also refused a request by prosecutors to remove the holdout from the jury because she had liked on her Facebook page another film that Arias found influential. And the case's chief investigator said the holdout, who had claimed she had recently been keeping away from Facebook, had liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated . Arias stabbed Alexander 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead . Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later .",

The details will be discussed at the coffee chain's annual meeting Wednesday. In Seattle, the company said it will team up with a company called Postmates to deliver to homes and offices within specific areas. Coming soon: Starbucks says it will start delivering to customers in select parts of Seattle and New York City later this year . Postmates said on its website Wednesday 'With such incredible traction on their leading mobile payment app, Starbucks delivery by Postmates is an extension of what customers are looking for today, and provides a type of convenience that was never before available.' The company's CEO, Bastian Lehmann, told Re/code 'Speed is the number one thing. We’re actually working with Starbucks on trying to figure out what the best delivery containers are. 'Is there a packaging that we can develop together? Is there a cup that’s a better to-go cup?' In New York City, delivery will be from existing or newly setup Starbucks shops in certain buildings, starting with the Empire State Building. On Wednesday, Starbucks said in a news release that the service is called  the 'Green Apron' delivery choice. Starbucks Chief Digital Officer Adam Brotman told the Associated Press there will be no minimum purchase required, but that deliveries will require 'a small flat fee.' He declined to say what the exact fee will be. Delivery workers will accept tips, too. Brotman said the average time for deliveries will be 30 minutes, starting from when the order is placed. Speaking about the two programs, he told Re/code 'The truth is we’re not sure exactly how it will play out. Is one the national approach and one for dense urban environments only? We are truly in learning mode right now but we’re excited about them both.' For New York City, people will be able use a website to place orders. In Seattle, people would place orders via the company's mobile app. The hours of operation for delivery are still being determined. In the meantime, Starbucks Corp. also says it's on track for a national rollout of mobile order-and-pay, which lets customers place orders through its apps ahead of time so that drinks and food are ready when they arrive at the store. The program was launched in Portland, Oregon, late last year. Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw says the company expects to see a lift in sales as a result of mobile order-and-pay by late this year. Mobile order-and-pay will launch in Canada this year as well, and be tested in the United Kingdom, according to the company.

Rick Perry charged on Thursday morning while speaking at a breakfast in New Hampshire. Obama said in his State of the Union address that ISIS' advance had been stopped, Perry said. 'That is simply not true.' 'He says ISIS is not a religious movement. Again, he's simply wrong.' 'To deny the fundamental religious nature of the threat and downplay the seriousness of it is naive, it's dangerous, and it's misguided,' the self-described 'wannabe' presidential candidate said at a Saint Anselm College Politics and Eggs event. 'To deny the fundamental religious nature of the threat and downplay the seriousness of it is naive, it's dangerous, and it's misguided,' Rick Perry, a self-described 'wannabe' presidential candidate said at a Saint Anselm College's Politics and Eggs event this morning. Perry is pictured here at a summit in Iowa last Saturday . Perry was the guest speaker this morning at the breakfast for major presidential hopefuls that the historic college lauds as a 'must-stop' event on the campaign trail. Photo courtesy of NH1: http://www.nh1.com/ . If the leaders of Jordan and Egypt recognize 'that we are at war with radical Islam, isn't it time that our president admitted the same?' Perry asked. 'The fact is we didn't start this war. We didn't choose it, but we need to have the will to finish it.' Perry was the guest speaker at the Bedford, New Hampshire, breakfast for major presidential hopefuls that the historic college lauds as a 'must-stop' event on the campaign trail. Other maybe-presidential candidates who have headlined the event in the 'First in the Nation' state so far this year are former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose appearance came earlier this week on Monday. Famed in presidential politics as the second state to hold a presidential contest every four years and the first one to hold a primary - Iowa, the first state to vote, holds a caucus - New Hampshire is a popular destination for would-be contestants for the Oval Office. The speech was an opportunity for Perry to flex his muscles and explain why he'd make a better commander in chief than close to a dozen other Republicans flirting with national campaigns. But at the end of the event, possibly unaware that his mic was still hot, the Texas Republican revealed that he was being coached on foreign policy by his friend - and likely presidential candidate - Graham. Asked to sign what appeared from a distance to be a program of this political season's Politics and Eggs speakers, Perry announced that he would sign his name next to Graham. 'Lindsey's my buddy. I am a big Lindsey Graham fan,' Perry disclosed. 'I think he's one of the most knowledgeable people that we have on foreign policy, and we, we need to listen to him. He is a very, very bright United States senator, who is ....you know he's carved out his niche, and it is foreign policy.' Continuing, Perry said, 'I talked to him night before last, just...picking his brain a little bit about what's going on in Ukraine, in particular...[Russian President Vladimir] Putin is, is a dangerous guy. 'And this strategy of kind of strategic patience with him, I don't think is wise,' Perry added, still talking about Putin. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday. Perry, possibly unaware that he was still being recorded,  admitted today that the Senate Armed Services committee member - who is plotting his own presidential bid -  is advising him on foreign policy . Obama said in a December interview with National Public Radio that he'd learned throughout his nearly six years in office the value of 'having some strategic patience' when it comes to Russia. 'You’ll recall that three or four months ago, everybody in Washington was convinced that President Putin was a genius and he had out maneuvered all of us,' Obama stated. 'I said at the time we don’t want war with Russia but we can apply steady pressure...being the backbone of an international coalition to oppose Russia’s violation of another country’s sovereignty, and that over time this would be a strategic mistake by Russia. 'And today, you know, I’d sense that at least outside of Russia, maybe some people are thinking what Putin did wasn’t so smart,' the U.S. president proclaimed. Perry, still miked up, said he doesn't ascribe to the Obama administration's theory that the slump in oil prices and economic downturn in Russia will crack Putin. 'You gotta remember the '90s and how bad it got in Russia,' Perry told an admirer. 'It's not anywhere near as bad as that now.' Perry asserted that Putin has 'like $386 billion of reserves' of oil and gas money that he put aside. 'It's actually a lot better now, and so, trying to wait him out is not a good strategy,' he said. Spelling out how he'd handle Russia's aggression, Perry said, 'I think you have to fund the lethal weapons to the Ukrainian military.' 'You take the SWIFT banking ability from him,' he said, referring to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, and international banking system, and 'go after the 1,000 people or so that actually run Russia and have all the money' - the oligarchs. Then, Perry said he'd 'flood Europe with liquifed national gas.' 'And that would really bring him to his knees.' Keynote speaker of a Monday Politics and Eggs program, Graham signs wooden eggs for guests at the political speech series in Bedford, New Hampshire . A spokesman for Perry did not immediately return the Daily Mail's request for clarification on whether the former Texas governor and 2008 presidential candidate knew he was still being broadcast when he made the remarks about Graham and Putin. Graham, a  defense hawk and member of the Senate Armed Services committee who is building his presidential bid around his foreign policy credentials, has also been critical of Obama's 'strategic patience' claims. 'I doubt ISIL, the Iranian mullahs, or Vladimir Putin will be intimidated by President Obama's strategy of \"strategic patience,\" ' Graham said last month in response to Obama's announcement that the mantra would drive his national security strategy moving forward. 'From their point of view, the more \"patience\" President Obama practices the stronger they become,' he said in a statement. 'The Obama Doctrine, or \"strategic patience,\" has led to a world in chaos.' 'Applying more \"patience\" to President Obama's failed foreign policy just prolongs failure.'",

        "input_text": "President Barack Obama today said the investigation into police in Ferguson, Missouri, has exposed a 'broken and racially biased system' as he prepared to mark a half-century since 'Bloody Sunday'. Addressing a South Carolina town hall, the 53-year-old leader also said the inquiry - launched in the wake of Michael Brown's 2014 death - has revealed an 'oppressive and abusive' police situation. 'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,' Obama said, making reference to the  Justice Department's damning report on blacks-targeted racial bias in the St Louis suburb. He told a room of both young and old attendees that Ferguson must now decide how to move forward, adding that America's top goal should be to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speech: President Barack Obama (pictured today) has said the inquiry into police in Ferguson, Missouri, has exposed a 'broken and racially biased system' as he prepared to mark a half-century since 'Bloody Sunday' Controversy: Addressing a South Carolina town hall, the 53-year-old also said the investigation - launched in the wake of Michael Brown's death - has revealed an 'oppressive and abusive' police situation (file picture) Commemoration: Obama's comments at South Carolina's Benedict College come the day before he leads this weekend's 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when police beat scores of people (pictured) who were marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the state capital, to protest against their lack of voting rights . 'Are they going to enter into some sort of agreement with the Justice Department to fix what is clearly a broken and racially biased system?' he asked of officials who are working in the city. Obama's comments at South Carolina's Benedict College come the day before he leads this weekend's 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when police beat scores of people marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the state capital, to protest against their lack of voting rights. The violent images broadcast on TV helped lead to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. During today's gathering, Obama made his most expansive comments yet about the Justice Department report, which found systemic racial bias  created a 'toxic environment' in Ferguson. The President, who arrived at Columbia Metropolitan Airport on Air Force One earlier today, said it was striking investigators had merely had to look at emails sent by police  to find evidence of bias. The report cleared Darren Wilson, the white former Ferguson police officer who shot to death 18-year-old Brown, who was black and unarmed, while he was on duty in the city in August 2014. Damning report: 'It turns out they weren't just making it up. This was happening,' Obama said, making reference to the Justice Department's damning report on blacks-targeted racial bias in the St Louis suburb . Future decisions: Obama (pictured today) told a room of both young and old attendees that Ferguson must now decide how to move forward, adding that America's top goal is to prevent similar circumstances elsewhere . Shooting: But Obama said he fully supported the decision not to charge officer Darren Wilson (right) in the death of Michael Brown (left) 'You can't just charge him anyway because what happened was tragic,' he said . Obama said he fully supported the decision not to charge Wilson - something that led to nationwide protests - telling attendees: 'You can't just charge him anyway because what happened was tragic.' He added: 'That was the decision that was made, and I have complete confidence and stand fully behind the decision that was made by the Justice Department on that issue.' However, in a separate report, federal investigators found patterns of racial profiling, bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement and court practices within the Ferguson Police Department. Shockingly, Obama himself was the subject of some of the racist emails from Ferguson police and municipal courts employees that were uncovered in the investigation. A 2008 email said Obama would not be president for long because 'what black man holds a steady job for four years,' while another depicted the politician as a chimpanzee. Prior visit: Obama is pictured greeting people at the Brookland Banquet and Conference Center  in West Columbia, South Carolina, today before heading to Benedict College to participate in the town hall meeting . Official duty: Obama himself was the subject of some of the racist emails from Ferguson police and municipal courts employees that were uncovered in the Justice Department investigation and reported on this week . Selfie: A girl takes a selfie as Obama greets supporters upon his arrival in Columbia, South Carolina, today . Although Obama said he did not think what happened in Ferguson was typical of the rest of the country, he added that it was not an isolated incident, either. He called for communities to work together to address tensions between police and locals without succumbing to cynical attitudes that say 'this is never going to change, because everybody's racist.' 'That's not a good solution,' Obama said. 'That's not what the folks in Selma did.' During his speech at the college, the President also hinted at what he will speak about on Edmund Pettus Bridge tomorrow, which is the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march. He said the commemoration is as much about stirring young people to change as it is about honoring past legends - and about 'the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things'. 'Selma is not just about commemorating the past, it's about honoring the legends who helped change this country through your actions today, in the here and now,' Obama said. 'Selma is about the courage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things because they believe they can change the country, they can shape our nation's destiny. 'Selma's about each of us asking ourselves what we can do to make America better. And historically, it's been young people like you who help lead that march.' He added: 'It was young people who stubbornly insisted on justice', noting that one of the most famous leaders of the Selma march - now Georgia Rep. John Lewis - was just 23  at the time. Arrival: The visit was Obama's first to South Carolina as President. South Dakota and Utah are now the only states he has not traveled to while in office.

The visit was Obama's first to South Carolina as President. South Dakota and Utah are now the only states he has not traveled to while in office. In a radio interview broadcast earlier today, Obama said improving civil rights and liberties with police is an area that 'requires collective action and mobilization'. He also spoke again of the Justice Department report, which hit the headlines this week after finding police officers routinely discriminated against blacks in Ferguson by using excessive force.

Keeping warm: In this on March 22, 1965 file photo, participants in first leg of the 50-mile march from Selma, Alabama, to the Alabama state capitol at Montgomery, Alabama, warm themselves around a fire in an oil drum . 'I don't think that is typical of what happens across the country, but it's not an isolated incident,' Obama said  on The Joe Madison Radio Show on Sirius XM radio's Urban View channel. He explained: 'I think that there are circumstances in which trust between communities and law enforcement have broken down, and individuals or entire departments may not have the training or the accountability to make sure that they're protecting and serving all people and not just some.' Ferguson's city leaders are scheduled to meet with department officials in around two weeks. During the meeting, they are expected to put forward an improvement plan.

Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested ten times, told authorities that she and her friends were planning to go after the 15-year-old victim because she had 'done something to a very close friend.' Ferguson was seen laughing and smiling as police led her to a car in handcuffs on Thursday. This as two more girls who were involved in the fight have been apprehended, including one 15-year-old who was taken off a plane in Atlanta as she attempted to flee the country for Jamaica. Three of the girls involved still remain at large. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Aniah Ferguson, a 16-year-old mother from Prospect Lefferts Gardens who has been arrested six times since last July, was held for the McDonald's attack . She was seen smiling and laughing as she was led away in handcuffs on Thursday . She is facing up to 25 years in prison for attacking a 15-year-old girl . Graphic cell phone footage emerged of the brutal attack on Tuesday . The two girls apprehended today include a 15-year-old girl was accompanied by her mother as she turned herself in, and the aforementioned 15-year-old who was trying to get out of the country. The New York Daily News reports that authorities had been alerted to her travel plans. As for Ferguson, her most recent arrest came last month when she stabbed her brother in the arm, and last year she was arrested after she punched her grandmother in the face and a month later when she injured an officer while resisting arrest. Despite this, her lawyer, Sarah O’Leary, is pleading for leniency now that she is being held on $500,000 bail, saying; 'She was making some efforts to better things in her life.' Ferguson, who belongs to the Young Savages gang, could be looking at 25 years in prison. The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and has been getting support from thousands on social media. The 15-year-old wrote on Wednesday; 'Everyone Like I'm Famous Now.' On Thursday, Ferguson detailed the reason for the fight with police, saying it had been in the works since January, and that it all began when she got a call from a male friend letting her know that the victim was at McDonald's. She then left her friend's house and waited for her other friends outside the fast food chain, and once they arrived the group 'put the beats on her.' After the beating was done, Ferguson said she was 'still mad,' and that is why she began kicking the victim's head as she lay motionless on the ground. She then took her purse, make-up bag and phone and claims she threw them in the trash as she walked out. The victim, who also has links to a gang according to the New York Daily News, continues to not cooperate with police. 'That type of behavior is not acceptable in our society,' said NYPD Commissioner William Bratton said. 'Certainly is not going to be acceptable here in New York.' The victim meanwhile has taken to social media to brag about the 'fame' the incident has brought her and mock the media response to the fight . The 16-year-old in the fight (left) who was stripped to her bra has been arrested, while the girl being picked on is so weak at the end that she collapses on a bench . The graphic cell phone footage emerged earlier this week of the brutal attack  that took place after class on Monday afternoon. The three minute clip showed an unfair fight that began with the victim  being set upon by six other students. As the girl is mercilessly pummelled by the gang her blonde hair extensions are ripped from her head as she is repeatedly punched and kicked. The vicious fight is cheered on by dozens of other youths who jockey for a good view of the senseless violence. The video, posted on Facebook, captures the afternoon brawl at a McDonald’s  near Erasmus Hall High School on Flatbush Avenue. Despite being outnumbered, the small girl gives as good as she gets and at one point she pulls a black hoodie off one of her attackers to reveal a bra. Towards the end of the video - which has been shared more than 19,000 times and viewed more than 740,000 - the smaller girl is left cowering under a table. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off. Bystanders can be heard saying, 'She’s dead,' and, 'You murdered her.' A few students then intervene, pick the small girl up and sit her on a nearby bench. Immediately she collapses and so the students help her to lie down. Finally an adult appears and attempts to break up the fight, but the taller attacker now stripped down to her bra kicks and stomps on her victim's head, calling her a 'bitch,' before storming off . 'The message has to be sent very clearly, that this kind of violence will not be tolerated whether in a mall or in restaurants and those involved should turn themselves in to authorities immediately so as to face the consequences of their violent actions,' said Brooklyn community activist Tony Herbert.

This due to the country's deteriorating security situation, as was witnessed on Friday when four suicide bombers in explosive vests killed 137 and injured hundreds more when they walked into the Badr and al-Hashoosh mosques in the capital city of Sanaa and unleashed what is now being called one of the deadliest attacks ever in the country. A fifth suicide bomber detonated his device outside the gates to one of the mosques. ISIS has since taken responsibility for the attack, but it is still not confirmed if they were in fact behind the bombings. What's more, hundreds of members of al Qaeda managed to escape from Yemeni prisons on Thursday and Friday. In addition, the Houthis issued a call to arms on Saturday to fight those loyal to the embattled President Hadi. Scroll down for videos . Yemenis and members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene of a suicide attack on Saturday in Yemen . Yemen's President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi delivers a speech calling for unity on Saturday . CNN reports that Navy SEALs and members of the Army's Delta Force are among those who were at the Al Anad airbase in Yemen and are now being sent out of the country. The United States had already closed its embassy in Sanaa last month. This after years spent working with Yemen in a quest to topple the terrorist organization al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. AQAP, which is based in the country, claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo shooting earlier this year in Paris. Members of the Houthi militia inspect the scene inside the mosque of one of Friday's suicide bombings . Further complicating matters in the country is the power struggle between President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and the Houthi rebels. The Houthis are a Shia group that has only recently gained power in the country after taking over the government in a coup-d'etat that some believe was funded by Iran. In January of this year, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace, and by February they had taken control of the government. It was at this point most Americans were withdrawn from the country and the embassy was shuttered. The Houthis also launched a strike against President Hadi just days ago at a palace he was staying at in the port city of Aden, the country's temporary capital. That same day 13 people were killed and 21 were injured as supporters of President Hadi and Houthi rebels battled in the same city. Then on Saturday, the Houthis issued a call to arms to attack supporters of President Hadi. This after President Hadi called the Houthis overtaking of the government 'a coup against constitutional legitimacy' in one of his first speeches in weeks. He also urged that all groups attend a peace talk in the Saudi city of Riyadh, and no doubt upset the Houthis when he also announced his plan to place a national flag in the city of Sa'dah, the Houthi base. Above all else he said he wanted unity for the country. Hundreds of Yemenis chant slogans and hold placards as they protest the suicide bombings . Meanwhile, should ISIS indeed be behind Friday's attack, that would make the situation even more dire as though they and al Qaeda are both extremist Sunni groups, the two have spoken out against one another in the past with al Qaeda finding many ISIS acts and attacks far too extreme. Making ISIS's role in the bombings more likely is the January decree of al Qaeda senior leader Harith an-Nadhari who spoke against the shedding of 'unlawful blood,' such as attacks in mosques. The United States has said however they still cannot confirm who is behind the attacks.",

The sentence ends the long-running case against John Fesler Lance II, who was so defiant in his claim to the property that he spent nearly 30 years in prison for threats over its court-ordered sale and then confronted the owners as soon as he was free. John Fester Lance II threatened from behind bars to forcibly take back the western Montana ranch he lost in a 1979 divorce -- and has been sentenced to 75 years in prison for intimidating and stalking its owners . Lance told the judge Wednesday that if he were released, he would again try to take back the ranch. 'You effectively described why I could never put you on probation,' District Judge Jeffrey Langton said, 'and why I don't think you should ever be released from prison again.' Lance was convicted of felony intimidation, stalking, violating a protective order and trespassing . The defendant looked thin in his orange jumpsuit in court, saying he had been on a 10-day hunger strike and would fast without food or liquid until he dies. He went back to the state prison Wednesday. Lance spent 27 years behind bars after convictions beginning in the mid-1980s for intimidating judges, attorneys and others involved in the court-mandated sale of the ranch. In recent years, he sent letters to current owners Lee and Lucinda Hayne and their attorney that threatened to use all force necessary to take his ranch back, including kidnapping, the couple said. He was released from prison last March and showed up the next day at Lucinda Hayne's workplace. He spent April through July in jail for violating a court order of protection. Lance was arrested again after going to the ranch on Sept. 15 and arguing that the Haynes were trespassing and he had the right to use force to evict them. They held him at gunpoint until deputies arrived. Lance, who was acting as his own attorney, refused to participate in his February trial and was convicted of felony intimidation, stalking, violating a protective order and trespassing. Ravalli County Attorney Bill Fulbright sought a 75- to 100-year prison sentence, arguing that Lance 'refuses to follow the basic rules of society.' 'Given that, it's our belief that the only recourse we're left with is to put prison bars between this defendant and the community,' Fulbright said. The Haynes said it will be some time before they come off 'high alert'  and can feel safe on their property near Florence.

The family, many of whose children were born in the Gloriavale Christian Community in Haupiri - on New Zealand's west coast - have moved 200 miles away to live with a 'normal' family as they begin reintegrating into society, the New Zealand Herald reports. Gloriavale, which was established about 45 years ago, does not condone the use of birth control and it is common for a married couple to have 12 or more children. Scroll down for video . Children dressed in Cooperite clothing walk at Gloriavale, home of the religious sect in New Zealand . Children at the school in Gloriavale Christian Community. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members . The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control . 'It's a huge deal for them to stop wearing their community clothes and so they are going to transition slowly,' Liz Gregory, who has offered the family of 14 her home, told the New Zealand Herald on Wednesday. The adults have forsaken their nun-like headdresses and white bibs to put on everyday clothes, while the children have removed their hooded hats and blue uniforms. When it was revealed that the large family had walked out - following other groups who have left in recent years - donations of money, clothes, furniture, toys and books, began to pour in to help them get back on their feet. The father, identified only as James, who managed the commune's self-sufficient dairy farm for 20 years, is now looking for a job. The community, founded in 1969 and which now has 500 members, is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian'. But it has been revealed that he was convicted of sexual abuse in 1994 and spent 11 months in jail. A Cooperite wedding at Gloriavale - a community which promised peace, love and seclusion from the wickedness of the 'outside world' The happy couple finally kiss and they are carried from their Cooperite wedding at Gloriavale . The population of the cult is said to be still flourishing - despite several large disillusioned families leaving in recent years - because there is no birth control. One young couple were married after just six weeks of courtship. Their website states the couple 'make vows to God and each other before the Church, for no preacher can \"marry\" them'. The marriage procedure is as follows: 'Then they go to a private place pleasantly prepared for love-making. As they consummate their marriage before God, He joins them together in a bond that only death can break.' 'They return as a married couple to a wedding feast with the rest of the Church.' The cult has several sources of income which includes dairy farming and deer farming. Gloriavale consider home births to be significant events with about 35 babies born each year, according to their website. Children, who are fully dressed, are pictured playing in the pool at Gloriavale . Members of the Gloriavale Christian Community, based ar Haupiri,  making iced buns . Speaking of the family of 14 who have recently walked out, Ms Gregory said they had 'come to believe they were in a false system and have left 500 of their family and friends (the only ones they've every known.' She added: 'They are hugely courageous…they are very excited about starting life out here. 'They are feeling blessed, but are aware of the road ahead of them.' Ms Gregory told the Herald that the family, who do not want to make any public comment, was in great spirits 'which is incredible, because what they have done (walking out) is massive.' A former member, Phil Cooper - who is the son of leader Neville 'Hopeful Christian' Cooper - told the Greymouth Star last year that he knew of two or three families that have left in recent times. The community is headed by Neville Cooper, known to the families as 'Hopeful Christian' He said that young people growing up at Gloriavale were cut off from the outside world and when they left they were not allowed to keep in touch with those left inside the community. This, he told the paper, had left people 'devastated' because of the emotional pain of people not being able to see their own mother again. Young people who had grown up at Gloriavale 'don't know anything else,' he said. 'My kids (living on the 'outside') have strong faith - they chose that. But (Gloriavale children) know nothing else.' Peter Righteous, spokesman for the Gloriavale Christian Community, told the New Zealand Herald that they did not comment on people who had walked out.

A credit union manager who told police he was held hostage, strapped with explosives and ordered to rob $4.2 million from the bank failed part of a lie detector test, it has emerged. Matthew Yussman, 46, had claimed two masked men ambushed him in his home in Bristol, Connecticut in the early hours of February 23 and held him and his mother captive. The next day, they ordered him to rob two Achieve Financial Credit Union branches, he said. He was ultimately found outside one of the banks with a device strapped to his chest, while his mother was discovered on her bed with another explosive beneath it. Both bombs turned out to be fake. Police previously said they had not determined if Yussman was a victim or a suspect but it has now emerged that he gave deceptive answers during a lie detector test the night of the attempted heist. He apparently lied while answering a question about his involvement in the home invasion, according to the Bristol Press, citing a search warrant for Yussman's home. New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said Yussman later withdrew from the test. 'He made the decision not to continue the interview a short time after,' Wardwell told the Press. The details emerged in search warrants secured this week for Yussman's home, car and laptop. Authorities previously took items, including his laptop and routers, and swabs from his home, and are investigating his cellphone and garbage bags taken from his car, among other items. The suspects reportedly ambushed Yussman in his garage as he returned home around 12.30am. Attempted heist: Police swarm around the Achieve Financial Credit Union in New Britain, Connecticut on February 23 after Yussman was found in the parking lot with a device strapped to his chest . Scare: Armored vehicles were seen on the scene before investigators learned the device would not go off. Yussman said two men stormed into his home that morning and took and his mother hostage . When his mother, who lives in an apartment on the side of the home, noticed he had failed to go inside, she checked on him and found him face-down with his hands zip-tied behind his back. Valerie Yussman, 70, told police that she saw the two 'well-spoken and polite' armed men in the garage and that they ordered her to stay on her bed. The men took Yussman from the home for 30 minutes around 3.30am after unplugging Mrs Yussman's phone, leaving her food and using duct tape to pin her to the bed. Her son told cops he was blindfolded and put in a car before they drove around for 30 minutes and returned to the house. It is not clear why they left the home. Valerie Yussman told police that she overheard the men saying they owed someone money and would kill the Yussmans unless they paid them. Her son and the men left later that morning after vacuuming a couple of rooms, she said. Around 8am, the bank's president called 911 and said Yussman had called him to explain his predicament, but told him not to call police. Minutes later, police found Yussman alone in his car outside the New Britain branch of the credit union and determined that the device on his chest was not going to detonate. Public works trucks were brought to the scene as 'shields' because they would be large enough to withstand a blast or stop a car from fleeing if needed, Wardwell said. Probe: Yussman, the manager of a Achieve Financial Credit Union branch (pictured), remains under investigation and search warrants have been granted for his home, car and laptop this week . The suspects had disappeared by the time police arrived. They are believed to have fled in a vehicle that looked like a white older model four-door Mazda, according to reports at the time. The incident sparked a massive police response involving dozens of officers and SWAT equipment. Schools were put on lockdown and roads were closed. Yussman was handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where he was for exposure to freezing temperatures while having to sit in the unheated car. His mother was not hurt. The investigation is continuing. No arrests have yet been made but police previously said they were looking for two suspects. 'We're considering all possibilities, whether or not [Yussman] was coerced, doing something against his will, or a suspect,' Wardwell said following the incident.",

Last year Google took its Street View cameras on a 10-day trek around the Khumbu region - also known as the Everest region - to explore these quaint landmarks and locations. During the trek the cameras captured the small Sherpa village of Thame, the Phortse Thakiri Chholing Gomba monastery and Khumjung inside the Sagarmatha National Park. Scroll down for video . Google recently took its Street View cameras on a 10-day trek around the Khumbu region - also known as the Everest region - (pictured) to explore the remote villages and landmarks of Nepal. During the trek the cameras captured the small Sherpa village of Thame, the Phortse Thakiri Chholing Gomba monastery and Khumjung inside the Sagarmatha National Park . The trek was led by Apa Sherpa, a 55-year-old Sherpa mountaineer  who holds the world record for reaching the summit of Mount Everest 21 times - more than any other person. He scaled the summit for the first time at the age of 30. In 2009, Apa founded the non-profit Apa Sherpa Foundation to help the local community of young people in the Khumbu region. The Street View images were captured in March 2014 when Apa took members of Google Earth Outreach, and the Nepalese nonprofit Story Cycle through the region. Mount Everest is the Earth's highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres above sea level. In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society upon a recommendation by Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India. Mr Waugh named the mountain after his predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest. It has become a mecca for climbers, and has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet. The southeast ridge was the route used by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay when they reached the summit for the first time in 1953. 'Our region is famous for being home to Everest, but it’s also the home of the Sherpa community and has been for centuries,' Apa said. 'The region has much more to offer than just the mountain. So last year, I guided the Google Maps team through my home region to collect Street View imagery that improves the map of our community. 'Now you can find Thame on the map and explore other communities nestled at the base of Everest, like Khumjung and Phortse.' Thame, and neighbouring upper Thame are small Sherpa villages in the Solukhumbu District of Nepal. Tenzing Norgay, one of the first people to climb Mount Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary grew up in the region and the Thame monastery is one of the oldest in Khumbu. Another village captured by the Street View trekkers was Khumjung. It sits 13,000ft (3,970 metres) above sea level near Mount Khumbila. It is located inside the word heritage site Sagarmatha National Park. 'When people ask what it feels like to reach the top of Mount Everest, I say \"heaven,\"' added Apa. 'My hope is that my children and future generations have many choices for employment outside of mountaineering.' But the images don't just feature peaks and landscapes. Google also captured parts of the Phortse farming village in the Khumbu Valley including the Thakiri Chholing Gomba, or small monastery. Paintings inside the monastery began in 2008 by Buddhist artists and were completed by the end of 2009 using funding from the Greater Himalayas Foundation.

The paintings on the monastery walls were started in 2008 by Buddhist artists using funding from the Greater Himalayas Foundation . 'Partnering with Google Maps allowed us to get important local landmarks on the map and share a richer view of Khumbu with the world, including local monasteries, lodges, schools and more, with some yaks along the way!,' continued Apa.

'Your online trip to my home awaits you on Google Maps. And if you ever get the chance to visit the Khumbu region in person, come stay at the Everest Summiteer Lodge that I built with my own hands. We’ll be ready to welcome you.' Everest is one of 14 mountain peaks on Earth that stand taller than 26,000ft (8,000m) and the local Nepalese name for it is Sagarmatha, which means 'mother of the universe.' Mount Everest is the tallest of these so-called ‘eight-thousanders’ and is the standard to which all other mountains are compared. All 14 of them are found in China, Pakistan or Nepal. Everest’s geological story began 40 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent began a slow-motion collision with Asia. The edges of the two continents were forced together and formed the tall ridges that make up the Himalayas today. Glaciers have chiselled Mount Everest’s summit into a huge, triangular pyramid, defined by three faces and three ridges that extend to the northeast, southeast, and northwest. The southeastern ridge is the most widely used climbing route. It is the one Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay followed in May 1953 when they became the first climbers to reach the summit and return safely. Despite its reputation as an extremely dangerous mountain, commercial guiding has done much to improve the safety of the Everest ascent. As of March 2012, there had been 5,656 successful ascents of Everest, although 223 people had died at fatality rate of 4 per cent. The satellite image was taken in December, just weeks after Nasa captured the rivers of black lava snaking over the snow-covered slopes of the stratovolcano Mount Etna in Sicily. In 2012, mountaineer and filmmaker David Breashears took 477 individual images to create gigapixel image of the Khumbu glacier from the Pumori viewpoint near Mount Everest.

Little Big Town has a hit with their new tune Girl Crush, selling an impressive 25,000 copies a week, a song about a girl who wants to get back her man. That girl though is not afraid to admit she is a little bit jealous of her former man's new lady however, and some are now claiming the song 'promotes the gay agenda.' Scroll down for video . The song Girl Crush by Little Big Town (above) has been banned by some country stations after listeners complained it 'promotes the gay agenda' The problem it seems is with one of the verses sung by group member Karen Fairchild, in which she croons; 'I want to taste her lips, yeah cause they taste like you / I want to drown myself in a bottle of her perfume / I want her long blond hair, I want her magic touch / Yeah cause maybe then, you’d want me just as much. . . I got a girl crush.' And for this, a simple tale of jealousy, some stations are saying they are getting just as much outrage from listeners as when The Dixie Chicks criticized President Bush back in 2003. 'Is it frustrating to you that here is your song - that is one of the Top 10 sellers for weeks and weeks and weeks - and people on the radio are still afraid to play it because they think it’s a lesbian song?' radio host Bobby Bones asked the group during a recent interview according to The Washington Post. 'Just the fact that we’re still discussing that, number one, there’s so many problems with that whole issue,' answered Fairchild. Bones, who hosts the most popular country radio morning show in the country then said; 'It shouldn’t even matter if it’s a lesbian song, is the first thing.' This is not the case for listeners however, with one individual in Texas writing in to say to a station after they played the song; 'You are just promoting the gay agenda on your station and I am changing the channel and never listening to you ever again!!' Alana Lynn, who hosts a morning show in Boise, Idaho, says she got a similar response from some listeners. Kacey Musgraves (left) went through the same thing when her single Follow Your Arrow included a line about girls kissing girls, but Katy Perry topped the pop charts with I Kissed A Girl (right) Newcomer Kacey Musgraves dealt with the same problem from country radio when her song Follow Your Arrow, listed by some in the industry as one of the best songs of 2013, was shunned as it included the lyrics; 'Kiss lots of boys / Or kiss lots of girls / If that's something you're into.' Despite selling over 500,000 copies, the song never charted higher than 43 of the Billboard chart for country music radio airplay. This has never been a problem on the pop charts meanwhile, with Katy Perry finding herself atop the Billboard Hot 100 with her debut single I Kissed a Girl. Now, the group has actually filmed a spot that explains the song, with Fairchild saying; 'It’s about a girl saying, you know, \"Why do you love her and not me?\"' The group did at least have their last song go to the top spot on the country charts and receive plenty of airplay - Day Drinking.",

        "input_text": "Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said Tuesday he wants new legislation clarifying that a new religious-freedom does not allow discrimination on his desk by the end of the week. The White House fired back hours later, calling Pence a 'previously defiant governor' who has suddenly decided 'to consider a position of changing the law' amid a 'bipartisan and even nonpolitical outcry.' Pence told reporters he has been meeting with lawmakers 'around the clock' to address concerns that the law will allow businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians. 'After much reflection and in consultation with the leadership of the general assembly,' he told reporters during a press conference, 'I've come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone.' Scroll down for video . Indiana Gov. Mike Pence now says he wants changes to a religious-freedom law he signed just days ago, as criticism mounts from gay rights groups . Protests have swirled around Indianapolis since the law took effect, with activists insisting it's a license to discriminate against gays and lesbians . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest unleashed a biting attack on Indiana lawmakers near the beginning of his briefing on Tuesday. 'This piece of legislation flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support,' he said. That, Earnest claimed, is why 'we've seen the governor and other Indiana officials in damage-control mode here.' The law Pence signed last week prohibits state laws that 'substantially burden' a person's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs. The definition of 'person' includes religious institutions, businesses and associations. Pence says the law has been 'grossly mischaracterized' and has put Indiana under a harsh glare – resulting in a 'perception problem' that he has to address. 'I don't believe for a minute that it was the intent of the General Assembly to create a license to discriminate,' he said. 'It certainly wasn't my intent.' But, Pence said, he 'can appreciate that that's become the perception, not just here in Indiana but all across the country. We need to confront that.' Supporters of the measure say it protects their ability to exercise their religious beliefs without shelving them when they enter the business marketplace. Opponents insist it gives Indiana residents and companies a legal loophole if they want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. The legal language itself doesn't specifically mention gays or lesbians . But the central controversy surrounding the law concerns whether or not Christians who run photography, catering or florist businesses should be allowed to refuse service to people who are planning same-sex weddings. Businesses and organizations including the NCAA – whose iconic 'Final Four' basketball tournament comes to Indianapolis this week – have voiced concern over the effect of the law, and some states have barred government-funded travel to Indiana. NASCAR, the stock-car racing circuit, joined the fray on Tuesday with a statement assuring fans that 'we will not embrace nor participate in exclusion or violence.' The organization pledged that it would welcome all fans in Indiana and elsewhere. Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post over the weekend opposing the Indiana law and a near-identical bill pending in Arkansas. At the White House, Earnest said it was no surprise that 'we see business leaders saying that they are reluctant to business in a state where their customers or even their employees could be subjected to greater discrimination just because of who they love.' White House press secretary Josh Earnest upbraided Indiana Republicans on Tuesday for the religious-freedom law, which bears many similarities to a federal law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 . Are you being served? Gay weddings are ground-zero for religious-freedom laws, as some vendors' religious beliefs prohibit them from participating in same-sex ceremonies . Three states have banned taxpayer-funded travel to Indiana this week in response to the legislation, as well as the city of San Francisco, California, and the city of Seattle, Washington. Connecticut became the first state on Monday to introduce a travel ban and was followed by Washington and New York. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo today directed all state agencies to immediately 'bar any such publicly funded travel that is not essential to the enforcement of state law or public health and safety.' 'New York State has been, and will continue to be, a leader in ensuring that all LGBT persons enjoy full and equal civil rights. With this action, we stand by our LBGT family members, friends and colleagues to ensure that their rights are respected,' he said in a statement. Connecticut's governor, Dannel Malloy, accused Indiana of 'outright bigotry.' 'The reality is, the governor is not a stupid man, but he’s done stupid things. And signing this law and, quite frankly, promoting this law, knowing exactly what it was going to do, was an incredibly stupid thing for him to do,' said on MSNBC. 'But even there, if you get the picture from who was around him when he signed this bill, there were three homophobic men standing alongside the governor. One of them who equated being gay with bestiality. That’s who he invited to the signing ceremony. He knew exactly what he was doing, and when you see a bigot you have to call him on it.' The Family Research Council, an evangelical group based out of Washington D.C. that lobbies against abortion and same-sex marriage and promotes religious liberty, came to Pence's defense on Tuesday, saying that Indiana has been the target of 'bullying' and 'misinformation.' It said critics' claims about the law are a 'complete falsehood.' Indiana's religious  freedom law is not 'about denying people a seat in a restaurant or a room at a hotel,' the organization's president, Tony Perkins, said in a statement. 'Christians would never deny people these services but being forced to participate in a ceremony that violates religious beliefs is completely un-American and uncivil,' he added. Continuing, he said, 'We must ensure that religious business owners are not forced by the government to participate in a same-sex ceremony.' Perkins said his organization would back a clarification in the law explaining that it 'does not impact non-religious goods or services.' Best intentions: Pence said Tuesday that it was not 'the intent of the General Assembly to create a license to discriminate,' , and added that 'it certainly wasn't my intent' Loud and proud: Whether or not Indiana's new law actually makes it legal to discriminate, gay rights groups have been promoting the idea that it does . Pence says the backlash has been the result of a willful twisting of the law's meaning by its opponents. 'That's why I think we need to focus specifically on this perception that this creates some license to discriminate,' he said. The controversy has opened up the possibility that the pendulum Indiana lawmakers pushed into motion could swing in the opposite direction. Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, a Republican, said Monday that state legislators should add gays to the list of groups specifically protected by the state's civil rights law. And Tuesday's edition of the Indianapolis Star included a special cover emblazoned with the words 'FIX THIS NOW' in giant letters, along with a scathing editorial. The newspaper's editorial board said the uproar sparked by the law has 'done enormous harm' to the state and potentially to its economic future. Pence seemed to be sticking to his guns on Monday, writing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that blamed 'critics and many in the national media' for getting their facts wrong. 'The Religious Freedom Restoration Act reflects federal law, as well as law in 30 states nationwide,' he wrote.' 'I abhor discrimination,' Pence insisted. 'I believe in the Golden Rule that you should \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore.'",
        "summary": "Gov. Mike Pence seemed to blink Tuesday in the face of withering pressure after he signed a 'Religious Feredom Restoration Act' bill into law .\nGay-rights activists complained bitterly that the law was a license for wedding vendors and other businesses to discriminate .\nWhite House says it 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support' & put Pence in 'damage-control mode'\nConnecticut's governor accused Indiana of 'outright bigotry' and blocked state-funded travel to the state .\nPence insisted that the law only gives businesses a legal basis to defend themselves on religious grounds if they're sued .\nIt doesn't, he said, make it legal to violate anti-discrimination statutes .\nThat distinction has been lost on everyone from the NCAA to NASCAR, with most opponents ignoring 19 other states with similar laws ."

Scroll down for video . What happened? Otis James Byrd, 54 (above), was found hanging from a tree in Mississippi after he was reported missing March 2 . Claiborne County officials prepare to leave a home in Port Gibson, Miss., where authorities were investigating the hanging death of Byrd . Lucas said that the body was found Thursday hanging by a bed sheet from a tree limb about 12 feet high, and that the man's feet were dangling about two feet off the ground. The hands on the body were not bound, he said. The results of an autopsy by the Mississippi Crime Lab to determine whether the death was homicide or suicide could take days, Lucas said. The hanging is being investigated by the FBI, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney's office as well as the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. The feds are there to determine if it's a potential hate crime or other violation of federal law, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday. 'We simply don't know enough facts,' Holder told MSNBC. 'We do have a substantial federal presence to determine what the facts are.' Vicksburg Police Chief Walter Armstrong said Friday that after local authorities asked his department to check on a report that Byrd had been at a casino, video surveillance was recovered showing Byrd at the Riverwalk Casino on March 2. 'We didn't see anything of significance on the tape. He was just walking around the casino. We did not see him after that,' Armstrong said. The body was found by state wildlife officers and had obvious sign\" of decomposition, suggesting that it had been hanging in the woods for some time, said Jim Walker, a , a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. The owner of the land, 87-year-old Johnie Baker, said that the area where Byrd's body was found is covered in pecan and black walnut trees. He added that hunters sometimes hunt in the area and that there are also wild boars on the land. Spotted: The last time Byrd was seen he was leaving a casino 30 miles north on March 2 . So far, authorities say it's too early to determine whether the victim's death was a homicide or a suicide. However, the NAACP is petitioning to have the U.S. Department of Justice involved in the investigation, fearing Byrd's death may have been a hate crime. The Claiborne County Sheriff's Department and Mississippi Bureau of Investigation are also involved in the investigation. Lynching was a common form of 'mob justice' in the late 19th century, particularly in the south. A report by the Equal Justice Initiative claims there were nearly 4,000 lynchings of African Americans in the Jim Crow era across 12 states of the US. Byrd spent 25 years in prison for the murder of Lucille Trim, the Clarion-Ledger reported according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. He allegedly robbed Trimm of $101 and then killed her. He was convicted of capital murder in February 1980 and then was paroled in November 2006. Trim is the mother of Martha Ranville, who was the first woman in the history of the National Guard to serve as State Adjuntant General. She became the Adjutant General in Vermony in 1997 and currently lives in Virginia with her husband, the Hon. Paul McHale. McHale is a former Pennsylvania congressman and assistant secretary of defense.

        "input_text": "It's the call centre accused of plaguing Britain with an incredible six million calls a day. Now The Mail on Sunday can reveal the chequered background of the man responsible – involving disputes with famous names and a string of failed businesses. Russell Church is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims, including the elderly and vulnerable, with unsolicited nuisance calls selling debt management and payment protection insurance (PPI) claims services. Earlier this month the cold-call 'factory' based at an anonymous business complex in Hove, East Sussex, was raided by the Information Commissioner's Office, which is responsible for the enforcement of the Data Protection Act. Russell Church is the main shareholder in a company that is currently under investigation for bombarding its victims, including the elderly and vulnerable, with unsolicited nuisance calls . The firm is reported to hold a staggering 90 million phone numbers that it repeatedly calls using sophisticated technology. Mr Church has a decidedly questionable past that includes: . Mr Church began his career as an entrepreneur in the mid-1980s in Brighton, where he lived until recently with his wife in a £1.6 million property. The 54-year-old has been the director of 19 companies, mostly relating to the publishing industry. But official records show that 18 of these firms have been dissolved, owing £3.4 million to creditors. In 2009 Mr Church was banned by the Department for Business for four years from setting up another business after it was discovered that four of his firms had failed to pay taxes and National Insurance payments totalling £120,000. Nuisance:  Anne Diamond took legal action against Church . Russell Church was the target of Anne Diamond's fury over a comic strip. Ms Diamond, left, and her then husband Mike Hollingsworth brought legal action against Church's company, Humour Publications, following a cartoon in Zit magazine. It imagined an affair between Ms Diamond and football legend Jack Charlton that resulted in a baby resembling ET – the infant was shown in a cot. The TV star took offence because it came out shortly after the tragic cot death of her four-month-old son Sebastian. Mr Church's lawyer, Matthew Higdon, said the cartoon went to press before the death of Ms Diamond's child, adding: 'The timing was therefore most unfortunate and entirely unintended by the editor. The action was settled on that basis and for the sake of expediency.' A spokesman for Church said: 'He was left mortified over the situation. 'The complaint was settled, and that decision was the correct course of action.' A representative for Ms Diamond confirmed that action was brought against the magazine. Mr Church has also been the subject of a number of legal actions involving high-profile names. The first of these lawsuits was brought by Ms Diamond and her then husband, TV executive Mike Hollingsworth, in 1991 over what they believed to be an offensive cartoon published in a magazine owned by Mr Church. In 1996, he landed in hot water again when his company Celebrity Publications brought out Boyzone's official magazine. The pop band's management said they planned to sue the firm when the magazine folded after one issue, leaving angry teenage fans who had paid a £30 subscription fee out of pocket. At the time, the band's manager, John Reynolds, said: 'We are disgusted with Celebrity Publications and their disregard for Boyzone fans. The whole matter is in the hands of our lawyers. Celebrity Publications were recommended to us because they also handled the official East 17 magazine.' Mr Church caused more controversy when he launched a monthly 'lads' mag' in 2004 called Sorted that offered advice on shoplifting and taking ecstasy. But this also proved to be a doomed venture and folded after four editions, owing thousands of pounds and unpaid wages to staff. Despite his financial troubles, Mr Church is now the majority owner of a call centre that the ICO says has cornered a sizeable proportion of the cold-call market. David Clancy, from the information regulator, said. 'It is astounding to think that this one small company has the ability to pester millions of people with unwanted calls on a huge scale.' The firm is based at the Gemini Business Centre in Hove and shares its address and directors with several other cold-call companies. For legal reasons, the company being investigated cannot be named. The ICO launched an investigation into the centre after receiving reports that its staff had been phoning people who had asked not to receive unsolicited sales or marketing calls. The watchdog suspects the firm used automatic dialling technology to make up to six million nuisance calls a day. These calls resulted in 'millions upon millions' of anonymous messages being left on people's home phones and mobiles with offers about debt management and PPI claims services. The ICO said the company invited victims to press 9 to speak to a call handler regarding a PPI claim, or 5 to stop the calls. But investigators for the watchdog said there was evidence that those who pressed 5 continued to be harassed. Mr Clancy added: 'I have never seen an operation of this size. Those targeted will have included the elderly or people vulnerable for other reasons. We received a vast number of complaints from hundreds of people who were frightened by these calls.' The ICO confiscated paperwork and computer equipment during its raid on March 12 and is considering what further action to take. Church once took thousands of pounds in subscription fees from teenage Boyzone (pictured, file photo) fans for a magazine that folded after one issue . Last night, Conservative MP Jackie Doyle-Price, who is a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on nuisance calls, called for firms to be 'named and shamed.' She said: 'You will then find out who is behind them and the chances are that anyone who's prepared to make nuisance calls is probably playing fast and loose with the law elsewhere. 'We also need to be taking action against those companies using nuisance calls to generate business.' Mr Church's lawyer, Matthew Higdon, insisted there had been 'no formal allegation, charge or complaint' received by his client or any companies associated with him. He said neither Mr Church nor his companies had 'received any notification as to any investigation by the ICO or any other regulatory authority'. The raid comes ahead of the introduction of new powers on April 6 that will make it easier for the ICO to fine rogue cold-call companies up to £500,000. Recent figures show that 30 million Britons receive up to a billion nuisance phone calls and text messages every year. The new powers due to come into force follow a sustained campaign by the ICO to make it easier to fine companies found to be making nuisance calls. The ICO has struggled to punish rogue firms because of the requirement to prove the business had caused 'substantial damage or distress'. But now the regulator simply has to demonstrate a firm has been a significant nuisance to apply fines of up to £500,000. An ICO spokesman said: 'This law change is a game-changer. The Mail on Sunday has exposed firms using cold calls in the past. In 2013, our undercover investigation revealed how one company, Lead Performance Limited, had phoned thousands of people to persuade them to release money from their pensions without warning of the risk of large losses. By Michael Powell . Nuisance calls are being taken to new levels of absurdity by firms that telephone the public uninvited – to offer services to stop cold calls. But what many people do not realise is that a safeguard against cold calls is already available for free through the Government-backed Telephone Preference Service (TPS). Two firms offering to block cold calls have recently been placed on a monitoring list of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The list features the 20 'worst' culprits based on the number of complaints and information from consumer organisations. Cold Call Elimination's director is Leah Masters (pictured), 31, who is pictured on Facebook enjoying holidays in Las Vegas and Marbella, . Cold Call Elimination has been warned it is on the regulator's radar amid allegations that staff gave the impression they were calling from BT to offer a Government-backed scheme. The firm offers services priced between £34.99 and £129.99 that include fitting a 'call-blocker' device to landlines to stopping unwanted calls from UK and foreign numbers. However, anyone can register for free with the TPS. Firms making calls without prior consent to people signed up to the TPS are breaking the law. Cold Call Elimination's director is Leah Masters, 31, who is pictured on Facebook enjoying holidays in Las Vegas and Marbella, and drinking from a bottle of champagne. The company denies any wrongdoing and says it follows all Trading Standards practices. It is not under investigation but is being 'monitored' by the ICO, which could order a full probe if it suspects illegal practices or non-compliance with cold-calling regulations. The firm denies its staff have alluded to being from BT or offering a Government service. It says it gets numbers from companies that sell data but intends only to contact people who have 'opted in'. Nuisance Call Prevention Service is also on the ICO monitoring list. It did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Double-glazing firm Zenith Staybrite has also been placed on the ICO list. The company is owned by HI Sales, whose chief executive is Ian Blackhurst, co-owner of Premiership rugby side Sale Sharks. A legal spokesman for Mr Blackhurst denied Zenith has had a 'significant number of caller complaints' or had 'acted in breach of the relevant regulations'. He added that Mr Blackhurst had no operational involvement in Zenith.",

        "input_text": "Wisconsin lawmakers voted Friday to make their state the 25th to enact 'right-to-work' legislation, pushing a fast-tracked bill through the Assembly after an overnight debate and sending it on to Gov. Scott Walker for his promised signature. The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate. It was a straight party-line vote, with no Democrats backing the contentious measure that will ban unions from forcing non-members to pay dues. A likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday. 'Today is the day we have solidified the regressive era in Wisconsin,' Democratic Rep. Terese Berceau, of Madison, said minutes before the vote. A likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday . Mary Will, left, with Local 68, and Corey Smith, right, with Local 113, chant 'Union Strong' during a rally inside the Wisconsin State Capitol as the state Assembly debates the right-to-work bill in Madison, Wisconsin on Thursday. The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 on Friday after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate . Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, walks off the floor after passage of right-to-work on Friday. The bill passed on a party-line vote, with Republicans in support and all Democrats against. The Senate passed it last week . The proposal would make it a crime punishable by up to nine months in jail to require private-sector workers who aren't in a union to pay dues. Supporters argued it would make Wisconsin more attractive to businesses looking to move in or expand. But opponents said the goal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat, and a right-to-work law would depress wage and create more dangerous workplaces, in turn hurting the economy. Twenty-four other states have right-to-work laws. Michigan and Indiana were the two most recent states to enact it, both in 2012. The protests from unions in Wisconsin were not nearly as large as they were four years ago when Walker and Republicans in the state legislature pushed through reforms to public sector unions, growing only as large as about 3,000 people compared with 100,000 in 2011. And only a handful of protesters were on hand for Friday's deliberations. Two people were arrested Thursday for refusing to stop screaming profanities, a spokesman for Walker's administration said. The vote came after Walker said in September, during his re-election campaign, that right-to-work was not a priority and wouldn't come up this session. Walker called it a distraction and feared that protests would grow as large as those in 2011 when he effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers . Legislative leaders, including Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, also said right-to-work would not be debated. But two weeks ago, when Senate Republicans said they were going forward with it, Walker said he would sign it . Pointing out that 'the bill would be dead if he opposed' it, Arnold Shober, a political science professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, told TPM last week that Walker had to side with his party on the issue. 'He knows that it will court controversy, but he cannot afford to lose potential GOP primary voters,' Shober said. A protester chants  outside of the Assembly chamber during debate on right-to-work legislation at the State Capitol on Thursday. Opponents say the goal of the proposal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat . Opponents of the Wisconsin legislature's 'right-to-work' measure rallied at the state Capitol last Saturday. The proposal, due to be signed next week by Walker, would outlaw the mandatory payment of union dues from workers . 'Legislative leaders know this, and see now as an opportunity to pass right-leaning legislation while the state political climate is very favorable.' Walker is scheduled to be in Iowa for an agriculture summit on Saturday that's attracting other likely Republican presidential candidates. The Wisconsin executive's well-established intentions to compete for the Oval Oval next year had state Democrats accusing their Republican colleagues of pressing the issue to help Walker's likely presidential campaign, even though Walker had said he didn't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics. They called on Walker to veto the bill. 'It's the workers in this state that are suffering through the politics of our governor's ambitions,' said Democratic Rep. Cory Mason of Racine. Vos accused Democrats of having 'Walker derangement syndrome,' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues. 'I'm not going to apologize about using the word freedom,' said Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt of Fond du Lac. 'I'm going to use it over and over again because that's what this is about.' Democratic Rep. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee, and a member of AFSCME, said she cares about people more than freedom. 'It just angers me to know that we come here and we pass bills that affect people's everyday lives and we don't have a clue as to how those everyday people live or how they survive,' Johnson said. 'This bill is a bunch of crap.' The national campaign arm of state Democrats, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that 'Wisconsin Republicans should be ashamed of this savage attack on unions and the hard-working men and women.' It called on Wisconsin lawmakers to put aside their 'right-wing ideology aside to promote policies that actually help the state’s middle class.' A crowd protests outside the Wisconsin Senate during an extraordinary session on the right-to-work bill last week. The group much smaller than the one in 2011 against Walker's law stripping public sector unions of much of their power and 100,000 protesters camped out. Still, the largest rally attracted roughly 3,000 people . 'Instead of addressing the real problems facing Wisconsin,' DLCC Executive Director Michael Sargeant said, citing a $2.2 billion budget deficit, 'Republicans decided instead to speed the passage of legislation that lowers wages, interferes with the operations of private companies, and satisfies the demands of the right-wing special interest groups that seem to have been calling the shots in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin since he took office.' Americans for Prosperity, a conservative non-profit with chapters across the country that spent $7 million to defend Walker after the 2011 spat with unions said Friday afternoon that 'every American deserves the right to work where they please without being compelled to pay dues, just as they have the right to join a union if they choose.' 'We’re pleased that Wisconsin is once again leading the way when it comes to worker freedom,' AFP Chief Operating Officer Luke Hilgemann said in a statement. AFP-Wisconsin State Director David Fladeboe said in a secondary statement that his chapter is 'excited to see this commonsense legislation move the state forward and finally bring relief for workers who simply want to do their jobs.' 'No longer will the Badger State’s employees be compelled to join a labor union or surrender union dues as a condition of employment,' he said and thanked the organization's volunteers for writing letters to lawmakers, calling their offices and going door-to-door in support of the campaign.",

        "input_text": "A 72-year-old woman is set to go on trial for shooting dead her second husband, nearly 30 years after she was acquitted of murdering her first husband in eerily similar circumstances. Colleen Ann Harris, whose case is expected to open on Wednesday, is accused of shooting dead her estranged husband, Robert 'Bob' Harris, in their Placerville, California home in January 2013. Decades before, in 1985, she shot dead her first husband and the father of her three children, 46-year-old James Batten, after claiming he had been abusive towards her. Both killings were carried out in the same home with the same type of gun, and in both cases, after pulling the trigger, she claimed she had temporary amnesia and could not remember doing it. Accused: Colleen Ann Harris, left, is about to go on trial for the 2013 death of her husband, Bob Harris, right, whom she shot dead nearly 30 years after she shot dead her first husband . 'In each case, she kills her husband in the bedroom. In each case, she uses a shotgun,' said El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander, wrote in court papers, the Sacramento Bee reported. 'In each case, she is going through marital difficulties. In each case, she delays reporting the crime... In each case she claims a loss of memory as a defense.' She was acquitted in her 1986 trial after claiming she had acted in self defense when her husband, whom she was divorcing, held a pistol to her head, threatened to kill her and sexually abused her. She said she couldn't remember killing him and a psychiatrist testified during the trial that she suffered from limited amnesia. The prosecution told a very different tale. They claimed she had shot her husband as he read a newspaper in bed and then killed him with another shot at close range, before putting a pistol in the bed to make it look like self-defense. She waited an hour before calling the Sheriff's Office. Scene: She allegedly shot him dead in the couple's Placerville, California home (pictured) as they were going through marital problems. They had separated but he had returned to care for her after surgery . The jury ultimately said there was insufficient evidence that she intended to murder her husband and she was acquitted of murder. Then in 1990, she married Bob Harris, who had two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 2004 but then married again a year later. Then in 2012, as Harris took a trip to Mongolia, where he taught environmental conservation to students, he met another woman and began a relationship with her, the Bee reported. When he returned to California, he and his wife separated and he moved out. But when Colleen Harris was house-bound following hip-replacement surgery, he returned to the Placerville home to help her. 'My dad, bless his heart, was there taking care of Colleen despite whatever circumstances were going on between them,' his son Andy Harris told the Sacramento Bee. Then on January 5, 2013, she overheard her husband making a call to his love interest overseas and later that night or the following morning, she shot him as he slept, prosecutors claim. She then allegedly drove to San Francisco and stashed her husband's cellphone, a handgun - not the same one used in the murder - and his coin collection, in her son's garage. After returning home, she called the lawyer who won her previous case and told him that she had shot her husband, prosecutors say. The lawyer then contacted the Sheriff's Office. Harris, who married Colleen in 1990 despite her previous case, left behind two sons and a daughter, right . Beloved: He worked in the Forest Service and as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department . El Dorado County Deputy District Attorney Joe Alexander said that Harris claimed she had been in a 'gray fog' but insisted she would never shoot her husband. Mr Harris' family said they remain devastated by the loss. 'The death of your father is devastating enough,' Andy Harris said. 'And then there is the person who is brought into your family and loved as a family member. 'There is a real sense of betrayal and wondering if this person had the capacity to love.' His father had worked with the Forest Service for 30 years before retiring in 1997, according to his obituary. He umpired baseball, from Little League to semi-professional teams, and worked as an instructor with the El Dorado Sheriff's Department. A judge has ruled that prosecutors may talk about the first case in the upcoming trial. Attorney Eric Schlueter had fought the decision, saying in court papers: 'The prior incident has ZERO relevance to the current action especially in light of the fact that Mrs. Harris was ACQUITTED of the charge.'",

        "input_text": "An American woman who went on the run for six years rather than face jail over a fatal DUI has been linked to a second death - after allegedly treating a backpacker with an 'African potion' at a backstreet Thai clinic. Kelly Lynn Miller, 36 - a former Alabama stripper and prostitute - was handed a five-year sentence for mowing down truck driver Donald Goodwin, 56, in 2004. Miller was released on $50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to Thailand, where she changed her name to Bea, switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her U.S. passport. Brazen: Kelly Lynn Miller, a 36-year-old fugitive, was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in Thailand . Victim: Brodie Smith went to Thailand with his girlfreind Kara Spark to attempt to kick drugs. He died after taking ibogaine at a 'clinic' run by Victor Cracknell and Mike Picone, his mother and girlfriend said. The fugitive, who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run, was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the U.S. to serve her original five-year jail term. However Daily Mail Online can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered Thai clinic. Australian Brodie Smith, 33, checked into the Ibogaine Thailand retreat on Koh Phangan island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction. Miller – a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two American expats. Victim: Miller killed Donald Goodwin, left, when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in Alabama in 2004. Miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time, when she was 26 . Former life: Pictured is the gentlemen's club in Birmingham, Alabama, where Miller allegedly worked before fleeing to Thailand . All three have been accused of administering Smith with ibogaine, a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an African tree. The substance is used in tribal rituals in Gabon and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction. However, the World Health Assembly warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous, and users say it sends them into a dream-like psychedelic state. Mr Smith's girlfriend Kara Spark, 26, says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be Valium - during the $5,000 treatment last October. The clinic has denied giving Mr Smith ibogaine, saying the backpacker from Mandurah, Western Australia, injected himself with an overdose of ‘illegal narcotics’. Thailand's Ministry of Health took no action over the death - but Mr Smith's mother Diane Tucker has called on the Australian government to push for a proper inquiry. She has also identified Miller as Bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat's principal operators, Mike Picone and Victor Cracknell, both from Buffalo, New York. Mr Cracknell is believed to be the father of Miller’s baby boy, who was born two months ago on the island of Samui. He told Thai authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive, according to the Phuketwan newspaper. Miller was finally snared on the remote island of Koh Lanta, off the coast of Thailand’s Krabi province, following a tip from the U.S. Embassy. Drug clinic boss: Victor Cracknell was one of the two business partners running the Ibogaine 'clinic' where Brodie Smith died. Smith's mother says Kelly Lynn Miller was the woman at the clinic who called herself 'Bea' Paradise lost: Miller was on the remote island of Koh Lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in Thailand on Tuesday. Above, a view of the island . Difference: This home in Helena, Alabama, is where Miller lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place . Thai media reported that at around 9am Tuesday local time, an officer with the Tourist Police approached her in the parking lot of a Koh Lanta guesthouse and asked to see her passport. When she was unable to produce the document, the officer arrested her. The pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention, casually reapplying lip-gloss as the cameras rolled. Thai authorities suspect Miller's relatives in the US had been wiring money to help her make ends meet. But Miller's mother Penney, 70, told Daily Mail Online she ‘laughed’ when she read about the accusations, adding: 'There's no money here to send her.' Unmoved: Miller looked nonchalant, and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in Phuket, Thailand . 'All my dreams now become impossible': Kara Spark, from Mandurah Western Australia, was with her boyfriend Brodie Smith when he tried to 'cure' his drug addiction with ibogaine in Thailand, she said. She went on: 'I only knew she was in Thailand because the U.S. Marshals told me. Other than that all I know is what I hear on the TV. 'She called me a few months back to say \"Mom, I’m pregnant,\" that was the first time I'd heard from her since she left. 'Had I had a chance to speak to her sooner, of course I would have told her to come back and turn herself in. 'At least I know she's finally coming home.’ Another island: Ko Phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by Cracknell and Picone, both from Buffalo, NY, was operating when Brodie Smith died. A third woman there, Bea, has been identified by the dead man's mother as Miller, who was on the run from Alabama . Miller struck and killed Donald Goodwin while driving drunk on Interstate 459 near her home in Hoover, just south of Birmingham, in September 2004. The Florida truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when Miller hit his vehicle and careened into him. Miller was due to go on trial in January 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty. Mission: Dianne Tucker, the dead man's mother, is campaigning for a murder probe into her son's death. She identified Miller as 'Bea', the woman at the 'clinic' when he died . She was set to report to prison but fled Alabama after making a $50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010. Probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $10-an-hour job to become a ‘self-employed entertainer’ making $4,000 a month. But Daily Mail Online can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double-life as an exotic dancer and prostitute. A law enforcement source said: 'Kelly Miller is a very pretty girl from a good, upper-middle class family. ‘She's not stupid. She's entrepreneurial; she’s a survivor. She is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men. ‘This business in Thailand fits exactly with the sort of person she is. She was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter. ‘There’s no doubt she was working here as a prostitute. She probably carried on doing what she was good at in Thailand.’ Miller separated from her ex-husband Brett Street before her fatal DUI crash. Mr Street committed suicide in 2007 but his father Chris, 67, insisted his death had nothing to do with Miller and described her as a ‘pretty, sweet girl’. Former neighbors in the quiet Hoover street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly. They told Daily Mail Online they suspected she used her three-bedroom, $350,000 home as a set for porn films. Business: Mike Picone, of Buffalo, NY, was the other business partner in the Ibogaine Thailand Clinic where Brodie Smith went for treatment before he died. Boast: What Cracknell posted on Facebook about what happened at the clinic . One said: 'This isn't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a Mercedes Benz or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend. 'I don't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes. 'We would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits. The girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes. 'The men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining. According to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries. 'She had certainly had her breasts done. They were very big - we called her Jugs.' Quasi-scientific: Victor Cracknell posted these pictures on Facebook of his 'clinic'. It did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms. The mother of an Australasian who died after attending the clinic says Kelly Lynn Miller was involved with it and Cracknell was the father of her baby . Bill Veitch, the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted Miller said she would likely have only served half of her five-year jail sentence for killing Mr Goodwin had she gone straight to prison. With good behaviour he predicts Miller will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more. ‘If she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years,' he told Daily Mail Online. ‘Now she's got a two-month-old child, honestly I think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life. ‘It really hurt Donald Goodwin’s family when she ran. They are just profoundly grateful to the U.S. Marshals for tracking her down.’ Root: Ibogaine is made from this root, of a plant found on the banks of a river in Nigeria. It is illegal in the United States and Australia and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects .",

Loyalist MPs are being privately urged to form a ‘praetorian guard’ around the Prime Minister to protect him from Right-wingers plotting to move against him if he falls short. They are being asked to hit the airwaves in the hours following the election on May 7 to ‘save Dave’ by making it clear they want Mr Cameron to stay on. MPs loyal to David Cameron are secretly planning to shore up his leadership of he falls short at May election . No10 fears disgruntled MPs on the influential backbench 1922 Committee may use a meeting on the Monday after the election to push for a leadership contest. MPs thought to be loyal are being asked discreetly to promise they will help nip any mutiny in the bud. One MP told the Guardian: ‘There is an attempt to form a praetorian guard round David. We are being asked to speak up for continuity and to say that our best option is to keep our leader... to counter the malcontents. 'It would be extremely foolish to replace David. He out-polls our party. The Right just obsess about their issues and never look to the bigger picture.’ The leadership denies it is directly involved in the ‘save Dave’ initiative, but a number of senior ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne and Chief Whip Michael Gove, are understood to have had informal conversations with MPs. Tory high command is even preparing to declare a ‘moral victory’ if – as some polls suggest – Mr Cameron secures more votes than Labour but wins fewer seats. A number of senior ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) are understood to have had informal conversations with MPs . Mr Cameron will come under intense pressure to step down if he loses to Mr Miliband, whom many Tories rate as the worst Labour leader since Michael Foot. One Tory MP said Mr Cameron ‘won’t last five minutes’ unless he manages to retain the keys to Downing Street in May. ‘He either wins, or he goes,’ the MP said. ‘He has said himself that if he can’t beat Miliband he doesn’t deserve to be in this game, and he’s right.’ But some senior ministers believe Mr Cameron should stay on if Mr Miliband is only able to cobble together a fragile coalition. In this scenario, they fear the party could be plunged into a destabilising leadership battle in the run-up to a second election that could take place in the autumn. The news came as George Osborne last night predicted he will be re-appointed as Chancellor if the Tories win a second term. He said he did not think this week’s Budget would be his last, suggesting he believes the Tories will win in May – and that David Cameron will let him keep his job. There has been speculation that he might move to the Foreign Office to lead the renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU. But he told LBC radio: ‘This decision belongs to the British people. But I have to tell you, when I was about to walk out the door of No11 and I thought “Is this the last time?” I honestly think it will not be.’ Action hero: Cruise in the movie series Mission Impossible, which Cameron compared himself to . David Cameron has compared himself to Tom Cruise – by saying he will win in his ‘Mission: Impossible’ tussle with Brussels. The Prime Minister says he will succeed in clawing back powers from the EU – just like the Hollywood hero always ‘prevails’ in the hit film series. Speaking yesterday at his final EU summit before the election, he said: ‘I’d make the point that if you watch any of his movies, you’ll find that Tom Cruise normally prevails in the end. He’s a little bit smaller than me but I hope to be just as effective.’ The PM, who is 6ft 1in compared with Cruise’s 5ft 7in, was responding to a comment from European Council president Donald Tusk that achieving renegotiating EU treaties was ‘close to mission impossible’. Mr Cameron also said that a win for Ed Miliband in May would cause arch-federalists on the continent to ‘breathe a sigh of relief’. A Labour victory would cause those who want ever closer union to ‘relax’, because they favour an ‘easy life’, warned the Tory leader. His comments suggest the Conservatives plan to put the issue of Britain’s relations with Europe at the heart of the election campaign. Mr Cameron added: ‘If Ed Miliband comes here in June, there will be no reform and no referendum.’",

        "input_text": "A  prosecutor who sent an innocent man to death row for 30 years  has apologized to him and admitted he was more interested in winning the case than achieving justice. Attorney A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, from Shreveport, Louisiana, admitted that he was to blame for putting father-of-four Glenn Ford behind bars in 1984 for the fatal shooting of a jeweler. 'In 1984, I was 33 years old,' he wrote in a letter to The Shreveport Times. 'I was arrogant, judgmental, narcissistic and very full of myself. I was not as interested in justice as I was in winning.' Ford, now 65, was released from the prison in Angola in March 2014 but last month, he learned he has stage four lung cancer and just four to eight months left to live. Scroll down for video . Apologies: Attorney A.M. 'Marty' Stroud III, pictured, has written a lengthy letter apologizing to an innocent man he sent to death row as he slammed the state for refusing to pay the man compensation . Earlier this month, the state argued that Ford is not entitled to receive compensation for his time behind bars because he is unable to prove he is 'factually innocent'. In his letter, Stroud, 63, slammed the decision. 'Glenn Ford should be completely compensated to every extent possible because of the flaws of a system that effectively destroyed his life,' Stroud said. 'The audacity of the state's effort to deny Mr. Ford any compensation for the horrors he suffered in the name of Louisiana justice is appalling.' Ford was accused of shooting Isadore Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Mr Ford had done occasional yard work, in 1983 and was convicted the following year. He was sent to prison, where he lived with little light or heat, while Stroud, who had been with the Caddo District Attorney's office for two years, went out to celebrate by having drinks with his team. 'That's sick,' he said in his letter. 'I had been entrusted with the duty to seek the death of a fellow human being, a very solemn task that certainly did not warrant any \"celebration\".' From behind bars, Ford continued to protest his innocence. Glenn Ford, now 65, was convicted of an 1983 murder but was released a year ago after evidence showed he was not at the scene. He has since been diagnosed with cancer and has four to eight months to live . Then in 2013, State District Judge Ramona Emanuel voided the conviction and sentence based on the new information that corroborated his claim he was not present or involved in Rozeman's death. 'My fault was that I was too passive,' Stroud said in his letter. 'Had I been more inquisitive, perhaps the evidence would have come to light years ago... Wrongly accused: Ford, a father-of-four (pictured in a booking photo), was sent to death row in 1984 . 'I did not hide evidence, I simply did not seriously consider that sufficient information may have been out there that could have led to a different conclusion. And that omission is on me.' Stroud said he still does not know the extent of the new information that led to Ford's release. But he added that the odds were stacked against Ford, whose attorneys were inexperienced in criminal law. He also faced an all-white jury. In light of the new evidence, Stroud said he realized how wrong he had been. 'I speak only for me and no one else,' he said. 'I apologize to Glenn Ford for all the misery I have caused him and his family. I apologize to the family of Mr. Rozeman for giving them the false hope of some closure.' In a separate interview with The Shreveport Times, Stroud again called for Ford to be compensated and for the 'barbaric' death penalty to be abolished. Ford walked free from Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola on March 11, 2014, wearing a jean jacket, sweater and beanie hat and carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes. As he walked out of the prison gates, he said he was sad he had not been around to raise his now-adult sons, but added: 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.' Freed: Ford is pictured in March 2014 as he was freed from the state prison following 30 years behind bars. He was given just $20 but was taken in by a non-profit group who found a free place for him to stay . Prison officials gave the then-64-year-old a debit card worth just $20. That, along with the money that he had in his bank account, left Mr Ford with a paltry $20.04 to his name. His lawyers set up an Amazon wishlist for strangers to donate funds and items - from furniture to clothing - so Ford could start to re-build his life. With the help of a non-profit group, Resurrection After Exoneration, he had a place to live free of charge and has since moved to his own apartment. He relies on Social Security disability and food stamps, and has also visited California to see his four sons. He has also filed separate federal lawsuits claiming he was wrongfully imprisoned and was denied medical care following his cancer diagnosis. He names numerous prison guards and prison doctors for ignoring his condition and says his poor living conditions, including contact with sewage and asbestos, contributed to his illness. After he left prison, he learned he had Stage 3 lung cancer, which has now progressed to Stage 4. Making the days count: Ford, pictured last month, relies on Social Security disability and food stamps. He is suing the state for denying him medical care for his lung cancer, which is now terminal . 'I'm trying to make every day count,' he told The Shreveport Times from his home in New Orleans after learning he had just months to live. He said if he does get awarded any money, he plans to leave it to his grandchildren. He said he has between 17 and 21 - but could not be sure how many. Of his situation, he said: 'I don't have no anger. I have anger that I have cancer. I have resentment Angola allowed this to happen. I guess everything is for a reason. I really don't know.' Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections spokeswoman Pam Laborde told The Times-Picayune that she could not comment due to pending litigation and privacy issues. No one has been charged with Rozeman's death. Three men had also initially been arrested in the crime but were ultimately released because of insufficient evidence. Two of the men have since been indicted in other murders.",

In a video, obtained by WISN, the girls both say they told Peyton they wanted to go bird watching, this after planning their attack on the school bus. 'People who trust you become very gullible,' Morgan told police. 'And it was sort of sad.' Anissa is more emotional during her interview, wiping away tears at one point. 'We told her we were going to get help,' she told police about the moments after the two stabbed Peyton. \" 'But we weren't. We were going to run and let her pass away. So we ran.'

        "input_text": "A police officer was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide after investigators concluded she shot an unarmed motorist in the back as he lay facedown after a traffic stop over an expired inspection sticker. Authorities accused Hummelstown police Officer Lisa J. Mearkle of shooting David Kassick, 59, twice February 2 without legal justification. She was jailed without bail. They said Mearkle had attempted to pull over Kassick for expired inspection and emissions stickers before he sped away. She caught up to Kassick near his sister's home, where he got out and ran. She had incapacitated him with a stun gun and he was on the ground when she shot him twice in the back, police said. Scroll down for video . An officer in handcuffs: Hummelstown police Officer Lisa J Mearkle was charged Tuesday with criminal homicide in the February 2 shooting death of David Kassick, 59. Mearkle pictured above (center) before her court hearing on Tuesday . Necessary? Prosecutors say Mearkle shot dead Kassick when he was lying facedown on the ground and didn't present any danger. She has contested that she saw him reach into his jacket - possibly for a weapon. However, he was unarmed. Pictured above leaving court on Tuesday in handcuffs . Mearkle was later released on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device . Victim: Last month, one of Kassick's (pictured) brothers said he had struggled with drug addition but was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer. He was working as a construction worker at the time of his death last month . Before the shooting: Mearkle above pictured in her Hummelstown, Pennsylvania police uniform . Mearkle, 36, told investigators she shot because he would not show her his hands and she thought he was reaching into his jacket for a gun. The stun gun recorded portions of the encounter, and District Attorney Ed Marsico called it the strongest evidence in the case. He said it appeared Kassick had been trying to remove stun-gun probes from his back. 'At the time Officer Mearkle fires both rounds from her pistol, the video clearly depicts Kassick lying on the snow covered lawn with his face toward the ground,' according to the arrest affidavit. 'Furthermore, at the time the rounds are fired nothing can be seen in either of Kassick's hands, nor does he point or direct anything toward Officer Mearkle.' Marsico said Mearkle performed CPR after the shooting. He called the shooting 'a tragedy for all involved.' In the wake of Tuesday's announcement, Kassick's younger brother Dale Kassick spoke out, saying: 'Nothing is going to bring my brother back. He should have never lost his life over a traffic stop.' However, Dale said he and the rest of his family were thankful for the community's support in the past month and the prompt filing of charges. 'It's not being swept under the rug, it's not being forgotten about,' Dale said. Last month, Kassick's older brother Dan said his brother had struggled with drug addition in his life. However, he said the construction worker was not the type to get into a fight - especially with a police officer. Scene: Above, a picture of the area where Kassick was shot on February 2, with police investigating . Serious allegations: Mearkle pictured above entered court on Tuesday, before the arraignment . The DA said a syringe was found near Kassick's body, and he had alcohol and unspecified drugs in his system when he died. Mearkle's lawyer did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment, nor did Hummelstown Chief Charles M. Dowell. The police department issued a news release that said it had cooperated fully, calling the matter 'an extremely difficult case for all involved.' 'We are servants of justice and must now allow the judicial process to conduct a fair and impartial review of the allegations that have been presented,' the news release stated. The offense of criminal homicide encompasses a range of charges, from misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter to felony first-degree murder. Prosecutors often narrow the charge later in the process, about the time when defendants are formally arraigned. Mearkle was released this afternoon on $250,000 bond and will have to wear an ankle monitoring device at home.

The Cincinnati Bengals star wrote that 4-year-old Leah, who has been bravely battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma for the past year, was told that her cancer is in remission. 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram. Scroll down for video . Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Wednesday that his daughter Leah's cancer was in remisison . Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease . 'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram . He went on to say; 'After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her.' He then went on to thank everyone from the doctors who helped his daughter to those who wrote her notes and everyone who shared her story. Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy. She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research. In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment. Leah and her dad have also written a book that aims to help children who are battling the disease . The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance . Leah's MBIG scans showed no active disease in her body, though the family is still waiting on an MRI and bone biopsy results . Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys. The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play. The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage. June 2, 2014 and March 25, 2015 are days I will remember for the rest of my life. As everyone probably knows, June 2nd was the day doctors walked into the waiting room to tell me my daughter had cancer. It was the most devastating day of my life. March 25th , however, is feeling like the best day of my life. Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION! After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her. It was not easy but every day, and every treatment Leah fought like hell and kicked cancers butt! I'm so proud and blessed to call her my daughter. She has made an impact on me and on the world, at the age of four, that I can only wish to make in a lifetime. Thank you to my family and friends for the support through all those tough days. Thank you to everyone who has sent a letter to give Leah and our family motivation to keep fighting, a toy that helped Leah get through her days in the hospital, and more importantly a prayer that helped God hear our cries for healing. Thank you to the doctors at CHOP for putting together the best plan of action for my daughter. Thank you to Child Life members Sarah, Laura, and Lindsey for really turning what could be a scary place into a place where Leah would enjoy going because she knew she would have fun with you guys. Thank you to the Bengals for taking on my situation and standing by me and my family and for helping to raise money to fight pediatric cancer. To every media outlet and persons that helped raise much needed awareness, thank you. Leah is not done with treatments yet. She still needs more to make sure the cancer cells do not return and to build back up her immune system and other damage from the chemo but I know my little warrior will get through it!",
